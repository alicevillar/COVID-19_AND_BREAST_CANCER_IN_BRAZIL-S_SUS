We used insurance claims data to understand how breast cancer incidence and treatment after diagnosis changed nationwide over the course of the pandemic.MethodsUsing the Optum Research Database from January 2017 to March 2021, including approximately 19 million US adults with commercial health insurance, we identified new breast cancer diagnoses and first treatment after diagnosis. We compared breast cancer incidence and proportion of newly diagnosed patients receiving pre-operative systemic therapy pre-COVID, in the first 2 months of the COVID pandemic and in the later part of the COVID pandemic.ResultsAverage monthly breast cancer incidence was 19.3 (95% CI 19.1–19.5) cases per 100,000 women and men pre-COVID, 11.6 (95% CI 10.8–12.4) per 100,000 in April–May 2020, and 19.7 (95% CI 19.3–20.1) per 100,000 in June 2020–February 2021. Use of pre-operative systemic therapy was 12.0% (11.7–12.4) pre-COVID, 37.7% (34.9–40.7) for patients diagnosed March–April 2020, and 14.8% (14.0–15.7) for patients diagnosed May 2020–January 2021. The changes in breast cancer incidence across the pandemic did not vary by demographic factors. Use of pre-operative systemic therapy across the pandemic varied by geographic region, but not by area socioeconomic deprivation or race/ethnicity.ConclusionIn this US-insured population, the dramatic changes in breast cancer incidence and the use of pre-operative systemic therapy experienced in the first 2 months of the pandemic did not persist, although a modest change in the initial management of breast cancer continued.",The authors would like to acknowledge Natasha Purington and Summer Han for their feedback on the statistical analysis of this manuscript.,This work was supported by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (AWK); the Suzanne Pride Bryan Fund for Breast Cancer Research (AWK); the Jan Weimer Faculty Chair in Breast Oncology (AWK); and the BRCA Foundation (AWK).,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,,,"Adult; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Pandemics",2022-05-27,2022,2022-05-27,2022-07,194,2,475-482,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Caswell-Jin, Jennifer L.; Shafaee, Maryam N.; Xiao, Lan; Liu, Mina; John, Esther M.; Bondy, Melissa L.; Kurian, Allison W.","Caswell-Jin, Jennifer L.

As pandemic recovery efforts are underway, we must be prepared to address barriers to timely access of breast imaging services, including those that existed prior to the pandemic, as well as any new barriers that may arise as a result of the pandemic. Patient navigation is an important tool that has been shown to address barriers to timely breast imaging access and help reduce disparities. Patient navigation programs can serve as a key part of the strategy to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on timely breast cancer diagnosis. These programs have been shown to be successful in promoting adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines as well as encouraging timely diagnostic follow-up, particularly in underserved communities. Further research is needed to explore the role of using a telehealth platform for patient navigation and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of patient navigator programs as well as more randomized controlled trials to further explore the impact of patient navigation programs.",,E.T.O. reports receiving research funding (AUR GE Radiology Research Academic Fellowship Award).,Journal of Breast Imaging,,,Humans; Female; Patient Navigation; Pandemics; COVID-19; Breast Neoplasms; Diagnostic Imaging,2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,2023-05-22,5,3,346-350,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Gong, Anna J; Lee, Emerson E; Visvanathan, Kala; Oluyemi, Eniola T","Gong, Anna J (Johns Hopkins University, Department of Radiology, Baltimore, MD, USA); Lee, Emerson E (Johns Hopkins University, Department of Radiology, Baltimore, MD, USA); Visvanathan, Kala (Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA; Johns Hopkins Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA); Oluyemi, Eniola T (Johns Hopkins University, Department of Radiology, Baltimore, MD, USA)","Oluyemi, Eniola T (Johns Hopkins University)","Gong, Anna J (Johns Hopkins University); Lee, Emerson E (Johns Hopkins University); Visvanathan, Kala (Johns Hopkins University; Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center); Oluyemi, Eniola T (Johns Hopkins University)",2,2,,,https://academic.oup.com/jbi/article-pdf/5/3/346/50416426/wbac093.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155196146,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Circumstances varied greatly by region and hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. These challenges have disrupted screening programs and have been particularly distressing for both women with a breast cancer diagnosis and their providers.
Summary: This review explores the retrospective impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary breast cancer care. It analyzes changes in screening participation, diagnosis rates, treatment modalities, and the delivery of psycho-oncological support during the pandemic. The study found a significant reduction in breast cancer screenings and a subsequent stage shift in diagnoses, with fewer early-stage and more advanced-stage cancers being detected. Additionally, the review discusses the psychosocial challenges faced by patients and the adaptations made in care delivery, such as the increased use of telemedicine. Despite these challenges, the healthcare systems showed resilience, with core treatment services largely maintained and rapid adaptations to new care models.
Key Messages: There was a marked decrease in breast cancer screenings and early diagnoses during the pandemic, with a shift toward more advanced-stage detections. While there was an increased use of neoadjuvant therapies and telemedicine, essential breast cancer treatments were mostly sustained, reflecting the resilience of healthcare systems. The pandemic significantly impacted the mental health of breast cancer patients, exacerbating anxiety and depression and highlighting the need for improved psycho-oncological support. The full impact of these disruptions on long-term breast cancer outcomes remains uncertain, necessitating ongoing monitoring and adaptation of care strategies to mitigate adverse effects.",,"This research received no specific funding from any public, private, or commercial source.

This study aims to explore the impact on breast cancer screening outcomes such as mammography and diagnosis rates.
METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv between January 2020 to October 2021 to identify studies that reported on the rates of screening mammography and breast cancer diagnosis before and during the pandemic. The effects of 'lockdown' measures, age and ethnicity on outcomes were also examined. All studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Rate ratios were calculated for all outcomes and pooled using standard inverse-variance random effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 994 articles, of which 7 registry-based and 24 non-registry-based retrospective cohort studies, including data on 4,860,786 and 629,823 patients respectively across 18 different countries, were identified. Overall, breast cancer screening and diagnosis rates dropped by an estimated 41-53% and 18-29% respectively between 2019 and 2020. No differences in mammogram screening rates depending on patient age or ethnicity were observed. However, countries that implemented lockdown measures were associated with a significantly greater reduction in mammogram and diagnosis rates between 2019 and 2020 in comparison to those that did not.
CONCLUSION: The pandemic has caused a substantial reduction in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer, with reductions more pronounced in countries under lockdown restrictions. It is early yet to know if delayed screening during the pandemic translates into higher breast cancer mortality.",The authors thank A/Prof Sue Finch for her assistance with the design and execution of the statistical analysis.,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Medical Screening,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Communicable Disease Control; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies,2022-05-20,2022,2022-05-20,2022-12,29,4,209-218,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Ng, Jay Shen; Hamilton, Daniel G.","Ng, Jay Shen (Melbourne Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry & Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Medicine, Malacca General Hospital, Ministry of Health, Malaysia); Hamilton, Daniel G.

Our study seeks to compare trends in breast cancer screening and BI-RADS assessments in an academic safety-net patient population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Patients and MethodsOur single-center retrospective study evaluated women ≥ 18 years old with no known breast cancer diagnosis who received breast cancer screening from March 2019–September 2020. The screening BI-RADS score, completion of recommended diagnostic imaging, and diagnostic BI-RADS scores were compared between the pre-COVID-19 era (from 1 March 2019 to 19 March 2020) and COVID-19 era (from 20 March 2020 to 30 September 2020).ResultsAmong the 11,798 patients identified, screened patients were younger (median age 57 versus 59 years, p < 0.001) and more likely covered by private insurance (35.9% versus 32.3%, p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 era compared with the pre-COVID-19 era. During the pandemic, there was an increase in screening mammograms categorized as BI-RADS 0 compared with the pre-COVID-19 era (20% versus 14.5%, p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in rates of completion of diagnostic imaging (81.6% versus 85.4%, p = 0.764) or assignment of suspicious BI-RADS scores (BI-RADS 4–5; 79.9% versus 80.8%, p = 0.762) between the two eras.ConclusionsAlthough more patients were recommended to undergo diagnostic imaging during the pandemic, there were no significant differences in race, completion of diagnostic imaging, or proportions of mammograms categorized as suspicious between the two time periods.

With this research, it was aimed to examine the relationship between women's wellness awareness and attitudes towards breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: The descriptive cross-sectional type research was conducted between 30 January 2021 and 30 July 2021. The sample of the study consisted of 396 women between the ages of 40 and 69 who were in the breast cancer screening population under national cancer screening standards and met the criteria for inclusion. The data of the study were collected using a web-based and self-reported questionnaire, Personal Information Form, Healthy Life Awareness Scale and Cancer Screening Attitude Scale.
RESULTS: It was determined that more than half of women postponed breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the reasons for the postponement were often fear of contamination. It was determined that there was a relationship between the participants' awareness of healthy living and their attitudes towards cancer screening (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It was found that approximately two out of every three women in the screening population during the pandemic did not have screening or postponed it due to fear of contamination.

This systematic review aims to describe the observed pandemic-related changes in clinical and health services outcomes for breast screening and diagnosis.
METHODS: Seven databases (January 2020-March 2021) were searched to identify studies of breast cancer screening or diagnosis that reported observed outcomes before and related to the pandemic. Findings were presented using a descriptive and narrative approach.
RESULTS: Seventy-four studies were included in this systematic review; all compared periods before and after (or fluctuations during) the pandemic. None were assessed as being at low risk of bias. A reduction in screening volumes during the pandemic was found with over half of studies reporting reductions of ≥49%. A majority (66%) of studies reported reductions of ≥25% in the number of breast cancer diagnoses, and there was a higher proportion of symptomatic than screen-detected cancers. The distribution of cancer stage at diagnosis during the pandemic showed lower proportions of early-stage (stage 0-1/I-II, or Tis and T1) and higher proportions of relatively more advanced cases than that in the pre-pandemic period, however population rates were generally not reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of substantial reductions in screening volume and number of diagnosed breast cancers, and higher proportions of advanced stage cancer at diagnosis were found during the pandemic.

Our study investigated the change in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer with the progress of COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 6,514 recently diagnosed breast cancer patients between January 1, 2019, and February 28, 2021. The patients were divided into two groups: pre-COVID-19 period (3,182; January 2019 to December 2019) and COVID-19 pandemic period (3,332; January 2020 to February 2021). Clinicopathological information related to the first treatment after breast cancer diagnosis was retrospectively collected and analyzed in the two groups.
RESULTS: Among the 6,514 breast cancer patients, 3,182 were in the pre-COVID-19 period and 3,332 were in the COVID-19 pandemic period. According to our evaluation, the least breast cancer diagnosis (21.8%) was seen in the first quarter of 2020. The diagnosis increased gradually except for the fourth quarter in 2020. While early-stage breast cancer was diagnosed 1,601 (48.1%) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.001), the number of surgical treatments increased 4.6% (p < 0.001), and the treatment time was slightly shorter 2 days (p=0.001). The breast cancer subtype distribution was not statistically different between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 period groups.
CONCLUSION: In the early stages of the pandemic, the number of breast cancer cases temporarily decreased; however, they stabilized soon, and no significant differences could be identified in the diagnosis and treatment when compared to the period before the pandemic.",This work was supported by the National Cancer Center Grant (NCC2210541-1).,,Cancer Research and Treatment,,,Humans; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; COVID-19; Patient Acceptance of Health Care,2023-04-03,2023,2023-04-03,2023-10-15,55,4,1222-1230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lee, Eun-Gyeong; Han, Yireh; Lee, Dong-Eun; Moon, Hyeong-Gon; Koh, Hyoung Won; Kim, Eun-Kyu; Jung, So-Youn","Lee, Eun-Gyeong (Center for Breast Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea); Han, Yireh (Department of Surgery, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Science, Seoul, Korea); Lee, Dong-Eun (Biostatistics Collaboration Team, Research Core Center, Research Institute of National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea); Moon, Hyeong-Gon (Department of Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea); Koh, Hyoung Won (Department of Surgery, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea); Kim, Eun-Kyu (Department of Surgery, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea); Jung, So-Youn (Center for Breast Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea; Cancer Healthcare Research Branch, Research Institute of National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea)","Kim, Eun-Kyu (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital); Jung, So-Youn (National Cancer Center; National Cancer Center)","Lee, Eun-Gyeong (National Cancer Center); Han, Yireh (Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences); Lee, Dong-Eun (National Cancer Center); Moon, Hyeong-Gon (Seoul National University; Seoul National University); Koh, Hyoung Won (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital); Kim, Eun-Kyu (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital); Jung, So-Youn (National Cancer Center; National Cancer Center)",0,0,,,http://www.e-crt.org/upload/pdf/crt-2023-364.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156954844,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Concerns have been raised that service restrictions could jeopardize effective cancer management. Thus, this study aimed to conduct an audit to verify this proposition. Methods We conducted an audit comparing two-week wait (2ww) breast cancer referrals in our center between May and July 2019 and 2020. The primary endpoints were changes in the overall referral rates, differences in the waiting time, and breast cancer diagnosis rates between the two cohorts. Group differences were evaluated using the chi-square test (χ2). A p-value of <0.05 at 95% CI was considered significant. Results The 2ww referrals decreased by 442 (28.3%) in 2020 (2019 N=1564 vs. 2020, N=1122). Referrals in 2020 were associated with a higher rate of two-week specialist consultation than referrals in 2019 (p<0.05). The 2020 patient cohort was associated with a higher rate of breast cancer diagnosis than the 2019 cohort (6.9% vs. 4.9%, p<0.05). Of the 521 patients who had telephone consultations, 29.2% were discharged, and 367 (70.4%) had post-telephone one-stop clinic visits, of which 9.0% had breast cancer. Conclusions The audit provided evidence of effective breast cancer services during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The study results could inform patients and the general public at large that the waiting time and breast cancer diagnosis are not compromised during COVID-19 pandemic management. The high rates of post-telephone one-stop clinic visits and cancer diagnosis may indicate weakness in triage and difficulties in diagnosing nonspecific presentation of cancer over the telephone.","We would like to thank Adam Richards, Cancer Services, Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Foundation Trust, and Mandy Wilson, manager of Oncoplastic Breast Surgery, Princess Royal Hospital, Telford, for their administrative assistance.

In addition, the patterns and prevalence of mental disorders according to the occurrence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed. Materials and Methods: From 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2021, psychiatric disorders were identified in 5174 female patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Ajou University Hospital. Based on the time when COVID-19 occurred, the pattern of onset of mental disorders in patients with breast cancer was analyzed. In addition, the prevalence of mental disorders according to the time of breast cancer diagnosis and age was evaluated. Results: A year before the diagnosis of breast cancer, 371 patients were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Of these, 201 patients were diagnosed with stress and adjustment disorders, and 97 patients had anxiety disorders. The overall frequency of psychiatric disorders after breast cancer diagnosis peaked two months later. Among psychiatric disorders reported before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of stress/adaptation disorders was 52%, and among psychiatric disorders reported after the pandemic, it was significantly higher at 94.7%. Anxiety was found to be high in the elderly group aged ≥ 60 years, and the prevalence of stress and adjustment disorders tended to increase in the non-elderly group. Conclusions: Breast cancer patients showed different patterns of psychiatric disorders according to age, time of breast cancer diagnosis, and the occurrence of COVID-19. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in treatment and anxiety about infection have increased the rate of stress and adjustment disorders in cancer patients. Mental health management during the pandemic and after cancer diagnosis can improve the quality of life of patients with cancer.",,"This research was supported by the Bio-convergence Technology Education Program through the Korea Institute for Advancement Technology (KIAT) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (No. P0017805).

Our study explored the uptake of breast cancer screening in Japan after the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed its association with the COVID-19 vaccination. We analyzed data from the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS), a web-based prospective cohort survey, and we included 6110 women without cancer history who were aged 40 to 74 years that participated in the 2012 and 2022 surveys. We examined the regular breast cancer screening uptake before and after the pandemic and employed a multivariable Poisson regression model to seek any association between COVID-19 vaccination and screening uptake. Of 6110, 38.2% regularly participated in screening before the pandemic and 46.9% did so after the pandemic. Individuals unvaccinated due to health reasons (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.29-0.77, p = 0.003) and for other reasons (IRR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62-0.86, p < 0.001) were less likely to undergo screening compared to fully vaccinated individuals. There was no long-term decrease in breast cancer screening uptake after the pandemic in Japan.

However, the effects on breast cancer screening in lower income populations are unknown. This study examined changes in breast cancer screening rates (BCSRs) during the pandemic among 32 community health centers (CHCs) that provided health care to lower income populations.
METHODS: Secondary data from 32 CHCs participating in an American Cancer Society grant program to increase breast cancer screening services were used. BCSRs were defined as the percentage of women aged 50 to 74 years who had a medical visit in the past 12 months (142,207 in 2018, 142,003 in 2019, and 150,630 in 2020) and received a screening mammogram within the last 27 months. BCSRs in July 2020, July 2019, and June 2018 were compared with screening rate ratios (SRRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: BCSRs significantly rose by 18% between 2018 and 2019 (from 45.8% to 53.9%; SRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.17-1.18) and then declined by 8% between 2019 and 2020 (from 53.9% to 49.6%; SRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.92-0.93). If the 2018-2019 BCSR trends had continued through 2020, 63.3% of women would have been screened in 2020 in contrast to the 49.6% who were; this potentially translated into 47,517 fewer mammograms and 242 missed breast cancer diagnoses in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of 32 CHCs, BCSRs declined by 8% from July 2019 to 2020, and this reversed an 18% improvement between July 2018 and 2019. Declining BCSRs among CHCs during the COVID-19 pandemic call for policies to support and resources to identify women in need of screening.","Conflict of Interest Disclosures All the authors are employed by the American Cancer Society, which receives grants from private and corporate foundations, including foundations associated with companies in the health sector for research outside the submitted work.

The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of the pandemic on breast cancer care in a statewide cohort.Patients and MethodsUsing data from a large health information exchange, we retrospectively analyzed the timing of breast cancer screening, and identified a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with any stage of breast cancer to further access the information available about their surgical treatments. We compared data for four subgroups: pre-lockdown (preLD) 25 March to 16 June 2019; lockdown (LD) 23 March to 3 May 2020; reopening (RO) 4 May to 14 June 2020; and post-lockdown (postLD) 22 March to 13 June 2021.ResultsDuring LD and RO, screening mammograms in the cohort decreased by 96.3% and 36.2%, respectively. The overall breast cancer diagnosis and surgery volumes decreased up to 38.7%, and the median time to surgery was prolonged from 1.5 months to 2.4 for LD and 1.8 months for RO. Interestingly, higher mean DCIS diagnosis (5.0 per week vs. 3.1 per week, p < 0.05) and surgery volume (14.8 vs. 10.5, p < 0.05) were found for postLD compared with preLD, while median time to surgery was shorter (1.2 months vs. 1.5 months, p < 0.0001). However, the postLD average weekly screening and diagnostic mammogram did not fully recover to preLD levels (2055.3 vs. 2326.2, p < 0.05; 574.2 vs. 624.1, p < 0.05).ConclusionsBreast cancer diagnosis and treatment patterns were interrupted during the lockdown and still altered 1 year after. Screening in primary care should be expanded to mitigate possible longer-term effects of these interruptions.","We gratefully acknowledge the enthusiastic help from Anna Roberts and Regenstrief Institute Inc. on sourcing of data for this project, Carlee Johnson from Health System Patient Access Center, and the tremendous support of Lynn Whittaker for editing and formatting the manuscript.",,Annals of Surgical Oncology,,,Humans; Female; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; Health Information Exchange; Early Detection of Cancer; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19 Testing,2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,2023-05,30,5,2883-2894,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Milgrom, Zheng Z.; Milgrom, Daniel P.; Han, Yan; Hui, Siu L.; Haggstrom, David A.; Fisher, Carla S.; Mendonca, Eneida A.","Milgrom, Zheng Z.

However, no studies have examined the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare among women at high (≥20 % lifetime) risk for breast cancer. This study fills that gap. Between August 2020 and January 2021, high-risk women (N = 225) living in the United States (US) completed an online survey assessing COVID-related healthcare disruptions. Descriptive statistics characterized the frequency of breast cancer screening (mammogram and breast magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable linear regression analysis with backward selection examined demographic characteristics associated with COVID-related healthcare disruptions. Since March 2020, 40 % of participants had received a mammogram and 12 % had received a screening breast MRI. On average, participants reported low levels of COVID-related healthcare disruptions (M = 1.97 on a 0-4 scale, higher = more disruptions). Participants who were younger (β = -0.21, p = 0.002) and not working (β = 0.18, p = 0.009) reported more COVID-related healthcare disruptions. Compared to non-Hispanic White participants, those from any other racial or ethnic group reported fewer COVID-related healthcare disruptions (β = -0.15, p = 0.020). Although few high-risk women received breast cancer screening after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, they reported overall low levels of COVID-related healthcare disruptions. Results identify subgroups of high-risk women whose healthcare may have been more affected by the pandemic. Efforts to encourage US women at high risk for breast cancer to return to routine preventive care (including breast cancer screening) may need to be targeted towards women who are younger, not working, and non-Hispanic White.","This work was supported by a grant from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (ASPO-19-002, PI: Conley).

This study aims to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively interfered with the trend and the direct costs of screening and chemotherapy treatment of breast cancer in a public and universal healthcare system.MethodThis was an ecological time series study using an open database of a public and universal health system from 2017 to 2021.ResultsIn 2020, there was a 41% reduction in the coverage rate of breast cancer screening in women aged 50 to 69 years (about 1 million mammograms missed). The total direct cost of breast cancer screening reduced proportionally to the number of tests (BRL 67 million). On the other hand, the cost of chemotherapy treatment was higher in 2020, both in advanced (BRL 465 million) and localized (BRL 113 million) diseases. In the time series, mammograms’ trend and direct costs changed from stationary to decreasing after the COVID-19 pandemic. The trend of direct costs with chemotherapy treatment for the advanced disease has been increasing and has not changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, in the case of localized disease, there was a trend toward reducing direct costs after the pandemic.ConclusionAfter COVID-19, there was a downward trend in breast cancer screening and its direct costs, an upward trend in chemotherapy costs for advanced disease, and a downward trend in chemotherapy costs for localized disease.",,The authors didn’t receive any funding sources.,BMC Health Services Research,,,Female; Humans; Pandemics; Breast Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; COVID-19,2022-12-02,2022,2022-12-02,,22,1,1466,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hyeda, Adriano; da Costa, Élide Sbardellotto Mariano; Kowalski, Sérgio Candido","Hyeda, Adriano (Federal University of Paraná, Postgraduate Program in Internal Medicine and Health Sciences, Rua General Carneiro, 181, Central Building - 11th Floor, Alto da Glória, 80.060-900, Curitiba, PR, Brazil); da Costa, Élide Sbardellotto Mariano (Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil); Kowalski, Sérgio Candido (Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil)","Hyeda, Adriano (Federal University of Paraná)","Hyeda, Adriano (Federal University of Paraná); da Costa, Élide Sbardellotto Mariano (Federal University of Paraná); Kowalski, Sérgio Candido (Federal University of Paraná)",9,9,1.05,6.01,https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12913-022-08884-5,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153321947,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

In week 26, the breast program was resumed at 40% capacity, which increased to 60% in week 34. We examined the impact of the suspension and restart of the screening program on the incidence of screen-detected and non-screen-detected breast cancer. We selected women aged 50-74, diagnosed during weeks 2-35 of 2018 (n = 7250), 2019 (n = 7302), or 2020 (n = 5306), from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Weeks 2-35 were divided in seven periods, based on events occurring at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidence of screen-detected and non-screen-detected tumors was calculated overall and by age group, cT-stage, and cTNM-stage for each period in 2020, and compared to the incidence in the same period of 2018/2019 (averaged). The incidence of screen-detected tumors decreased during weeks 12-13, reached almost zero during weeks 14-25, and increased during weeks 26-35. Incidence of non-screen-detected tumors decreased to a lesser extent during weeks 12-16. The decrease in incidence was seen in all age groups and mainly occurred for cTis, cT1, DCIS, and stage I tumors. Due to the suspension of the breast cancer screening program, and the restart at reduced capacity, the incidence of screen-detected breast tumors decreased by 67% during weeks 9-35 2020, which equates to about 2000 potentially delayed breast cancer diagnoses. Up to August 2020 there was no indication of a shift towards higher stage breast cancers after restart of the screening.","We thank the NCR for providing the data and their data managers for collecting the data.

Due to the rapid transmission and the high fatality rate, drastic emergency restrictions were issued, with a negative impact on routine clinical activities. In particular, in Italy, many authors have reported a reduction in the number of breast cancer diagnoses and critical problems in the management of patients who accessed the breast units during the dramatic first months of the pandemic. Our study aims to analyze the global impact of COVID-19 in the two years of the pandemic (2020-2021) on the surgical management of breast cancer by comparing them with the previous two years.
METHODS: In our retrospective study, we analyzed all cases of breast cancer diagnosed and surgically treated at the breast unit of ""Città della Salute e della Scienza"" in Turin, Italy, making a comparison between the 2018-2019 pre-pandemic period and the 2020-2021 pandemic period.
RESULTS: We included in our analysis 1331 breast cancer cases surgically treated from January 2018 to December 2021. A total of 726 patients were treated in the pre-pandemic years and 605 in the pandemic period (-121 cases, 9%). No significant differences were observed regarding diagnosis (screening vs. no screening) and timing between radiological diagnosis and surgery for both in situ and invasive tumors. There were no variations in the breast surgical approach (mastectomy vs. conservative surgery), while a reduction in axillary dissection compared to the sentinel lymph node in the pandemic period was observed (p-value < 0.001). Regarding the biological characteristics of breast cancers, we observed a greater number of grades 2-3 (p-value = 0.007), pT stage 3-4 breast cancer surgically treated without previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p-value = 0.03), and a reduction in luminal B tumors (p-value = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we report a limited reduction in surgical activity for breast cancer treatment considering the entire pandemic period (2020-2021). These results suggest a prompt resumption of surgical activity similar to the pre-pandemic period.",,This research received no external funding.,Current Oncology,,,Humans; Female; COVID-19; Breast Neoplasms; Mastectomy; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies,2023-05-05,2023,2023-05-05,,30,5,4767-4778,All OA; Gold,Article,"Borella, Fulvio; Bertero, Luca; Di Giovanni, Fabrizia; Witel, Gianluca; Orlando, Giulia; Ricci, Alessia Andrea; Pittaro, Alessandra; Castellano, Isabella; Cassoni, Paola","Borella, Fulvio (Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit 1, Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy;, fulvio.borella87@gmail.com); Bertero, Luca (Pathology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy); Di Giovanni, Fabrizia (Pathology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy); Witel, Gianluca (Pathology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy); Orlando, Giulia (Pathology Unit, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy); Ricci, Alessia Andrea (Pathology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy); Pittaro, Alessandra (Pathology Unit, Città della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital, 10126 Turin, Italy); Castellano, Isabella (Pathology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy); Cassoni, Paola (Pathology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy)","Castellano, Isabella (University of Turin)","Borella, Fulvio (University of Turin); Bertero, Luca (University of Turin); Di Giovanni, Fabrizia (University of Turin); Witel, Gianluca (University of Turin); Orlando, Giulia (University of Turin); Ricci, Alessia Andrea (University of Turin); Pittaro, Alessandra (Pathology Unit, Città della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital, 10126 Turin, Italy); Castellano, Isabella (University of Turin); Cassoni, Paola (University of Turin)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1718-7729/30/5/359/pdf?version=1683270134,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157827151,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being
9252,pub.1158242697,10.1002/pon.6152,37212636,,Psychosocial well‐being during the COVID‐19 pandemic among women with and without breast cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment delays in combination with general social distancing practices to reduce transmission may have negative impacts on the mental health of women with breast cancer who may need more social and emotional support. We sought to elucidate the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among women with and without breast cancer in New York City.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among women aged 18+ across the spectrum of breast health care at New York Presbyterian (NYP)-Weill Cornell, NYP-Brooklyn Methodist Hospital and NYP-Queens. Women were contacted between June and October 2021 to assess their self-reported depression, stress, and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared women who were recently diagnosed, those with a history of breast cancer, and women without cancer whose other health visits were delayed during the pandemic.
RESULTS: There were 85 women who completed the survey. Breast cancer survivors (42%) were the least likely to report a delay in care due to COVID compared to breast cancer patients who were recently diagnosed (67%) and women without cancer (67%). Compared to women without cancer and breast cancer survivors, women recently diagnosed with breast cancer reported higher levels of anxiety and depression with a statistically significant difference in perceived stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need to identify and risk-stratify patients facing a new breast cancer diagnosis in and around the COVID-19 pandemic who may benefit from additional resources to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic and a breast cancer diagnosis on psychosocial health.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is funded, in part, by the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center.

RESULT: In 2019, a total of 3,068,776 mammograms were conducted, which significantly decreased to 1,808,765 in 2020.  Since the onset of the pandemic in Brazil in March 2020, there has been a reduction in the number of mammograms performed.  Mammography coverage increased from 0.11 to 0.18 between 2014 and 2019 but sharply declined from 0.18 to 0.10 between 2019 and 2020.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on breast cancer screening efforts, especially in detecting the disease in early stages.  Health services shifted their focus towards caring for COVID-19 patients, therefore neglecting routine screening programs and interventions. Additionally, the population's fear of contagion contributed to a decrease in demand for screening tests.",This work was supported by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES),,Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,,,Humans; COVID-19; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Mammography; Early Detection of Cancer; Cross-Sectional Studies; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Brazil; Middle Aged; Adult; Mass Screening; Aged,2024-08-01,2024,2024-08-01,2024-08-01,25,8,2703-2710,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stevanato, Kely Paviani; Pelloso, Fernando Castilho; Borghesan, Deise Helena Pelloso; Ribeiro, Helena Fiats; de Barros Carvalho, Maria Dalva; Pelloso, Sandra Marisa","Stevanato, Kely Paviani (Department of Health Sciences, State University of Maringá, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil.); Pelloso, Fernando Castilho (Department of Medicine, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil.); Borghesan, Deise Helena Pelloso (Department of Aesthetics and cosmetics, Ingá University Center, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil.); Ribeiro, Helena Fiats (Department of Health Sciences, State University of Maringá, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil.); de Barros Carvalho, Maria Dalva (Department of Health Sciences, State University of Maringá, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil.); Pelloso, Sandra Marisa (Department of Health Sciences, State University of Maringá, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil.)","Stevanato, Kely Paviani (State University of Maringá)","Stevanato, Kely Paviani (State University of Maringá); Pelloso, Fernando Castilho (Federal University of Paraná); Borghesan, Deise Helena Pelloso (Department of Aesthetics and cosmetics, Ingá University Center, Maringá, Paraná, Brazil.); Ribeiro, Helena Fiats (State University of Maringá); de Barros Carvalho, Maria Dalva (State University of Maringá); Pelloso, Sandra Marisa (State University of Maringá)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.31557/apjcp.2024.25.8.2703,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175236609,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Since March 2020, Breastcancer.org experienced a sustained surge in requested pandemic-related information and support. To characterize the pandemic-related experiences of breast cancer patients, we surveyed the Breastcancer.org Community early in the COVID-19 era.
METHODS: Breastcancer.org Community members were invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their experience during the pandemic. Self-reported data on demographics, comorbidities, care disruptions, anxiety, coping ability, telemedicine use, and satisfaction with care were collected. Results were analyzed using Stata 16.0 (Stata Corp., Inc).
RESULTS: Included were 568 current and previous breast cancer patients, primarily with U.S. residence. Overall, 43.8% reported at least one comorbidity associated with severe COVID-19 illness and 61.9% experienced care delays. Moderate to extreme anxiety about contracting COVID-19 was reported by 36.5%, increasing with number of comorbidities (33.0% vs. 55.4%, p = 0.021), current breast cancer diagnosis (30.4% vs. 42.5%, p = 0.011), and poorer coping ability (15.5% vs. 53.9%, p < 0.0001). Moderate to extreme anxiety about cancer care disruptions was reported by 29.1%, increasing with current breast cancer diagnosis (19.1% vs. 38.9%, p < 0.0001), actual delayed care (18.9% vs. 35.3%, p < 0.0001), and poorer coping ability (13.1% vs. 57.7%, p < 0.0001). Most utilized telehealth and found it helpful, but also expressed increased anxiety and subjectively expressed that these were less preferable.
CONCLUSION: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety was reported by a large proportion of breast cancer patients, with increased prevalence in those with risk factors. Attention to mental health is critical, as emotional distress not only harms quality of life but may also compromise outcomes.","CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Com-puted tomography (CT) scans of the chest, frequently performed in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, may detect asymptomatic breast abnormalities. A 72-year-old patient, with a severe form of COVID-19 underwent a diagnostic CT scan. This led to the unexpected discovery, at an early stage, of a 12 mm, high grade, Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive BC, with a high proliferation index. After responding to chemotherapy, she was managed with conser-vative breast surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Delayed management of BC can be responsible for poor outcomes. Patients with severe forms of COVID-19 are also at risk for developing BC due to common risk factors. Thirty percent of incidental breast lesions discovered on CT scans are undiagnosed BC. Careful study of the mammary glands on CT scan of patients with COVID-19 may allow early diagnosis of a malignant tumor in a high-risk population for BC and deprived of routine screening mammography.",,,European Journal of Breast Health,,,,2022-12-30,2022,2022-12-30,2022-12-30,18,1,91-93,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vibert, Florence; Martel, Camille; Ionescu, Raluca Andreea; Mathelin, Carole; Ame, Shanti","Vibert, Florence (Department of Surgery, ICANS (Institut de cancérologie Strasbourg Europe), Strasbourg, France.); Martel, Camille (Department of Surgery, ICANS (Institut de cancérologie Strasbourg Europe), Strasbourg, France.); Ionescu, Raluca Andreea (Department of Radiology, Nouvel Hôpital Civil - Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.); Mathelin, Carole (Department of Surgery, ICANS (Institut de cancérologie Strasbourg Europe), Strasbourg, France.); Ame, Shanti (Department of Hemato-oncology, ICANS (Institut de cancérologie Strasbourg Europe), Strasbourg, France.)",,"Vibert, Florence (Institut de Cancérologie Strasbourg); Martel, Camille (Institut de Cancérologie Strasbourg); Ionescu, Raluca Andreea (Hôpital Civil, Strasbourg); Mathelin, Carole (Institut de Cancérologie Strasbourg); Ame, Shanti (Institut de Cancérologie Strasbourg)",2,1,0.11,1.12,https://doi.org/10.4274/ejbh.galenos.2021.2021-4-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144308472,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

The objective of this study was to explore patient perspectives on the timeliness of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment at accredited breast cancer centers.MethodsIn this qualitative study, 1 hour virtual interviews were conducted with participants 18–75 years old who were diagnosed and treated for stage 0–III breast cancer at a National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers facility from 2018 to 2022. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes of participant experiences.ResultsTwenty-eight participants were interviewed. Two thematic domains were identified: etiologies of expedited or delayed care and the impact of delayed or expedited care on patients. Within these domains, multiple themes emerged. For etiologies of expedited or delayed care, participants discussed (1) the effect of scheduling appointments, (2) the COVID-19 pandemic, (3) dissatisfaction with the timeline for various parts of the diagnostic workup, and (4) delays related to patient factors, including socioeconomic status. For the impact of expedited or delayed care, patients discussed (1) the emotional and mental impact of waiting, (2) the importance of communication and clear expectations, and (3) the impact of electronic health portals. Patients desired each care interval (e.g., the time from mammogram to breast biopsy) to be approximately 7 days, with longer intervals sometimes preferred prior to surgery.ConclusionThese patient interviews identify areas of delay and provide patient-centered, actionable items to improve the timeliness of breast cancer care.",The authors acknowledge the Breast Cancer Mary Dillon Research Fund and the efforts of Samuel Christiansen who assisted with data coding.,This work was supported in part by the Breast Cancer Mary Dillon Research Fund.,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,,,Humans; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Adult; Qualitative Research; COVID-19; Aged; Time-to-Treatment; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult; Patient Satisfaction; Adolescent; Appointments and Schedules,2024-07-04,2024,2024-07-04,2024-11,208,1,123-132,Closed,Article,"Fefferman, Marie L.; Stump, Tammy K.; Thompson, Danielle; Simovic, Sandra; Medenwald, Riley J.; Yao, Katharine","Fefferman, Marie L.

Six-hundred and sixty-five high-risk breast patients from 23 January 2018-30 September 2021 were included. Delays were determined by comparing the time in between each patients' MRI screening exams prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to the time in between MRI screening exams during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the time in between exams when our patients started receiving vaccinations. Delays were analyzed via logistical regression with demographic and socioeconomic factors to determine if there was an association between these factors and delays. Significant time delays in between MRI screening exams were found between the pre-COVID timeframe compared to during the height of COVID. Significant time delays also persisted during the timeframe after patients started getting vaccinations. There were no associations with delays and socioeconomic or demographic factors. Significant time delays were found in between MRI high-risk breast cancer screening examinations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We examined whether there was any change in the diagnosis or treatment of breast cancer during the pandemic as compared to previous years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population comprised all women aged ≥18 years diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015-2021 with data obtained from the clinical quality registry of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). Data on socioeconomic factors were retrieved from Statistics Denmark. Prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from a generalised linear model (GLM) with a log link for the Poisson family with robust standard errors (SE) of each outcome, using the COVID-19 pandemic period in Denmark as the exposure of interest.
RESULTS: In total, 30,598 breast cancers were diagnosed during the study period. There was a small decrease (4.5%) in the total number of breast cancer cases in 2020 compared with previous years. During the pandemic, a lower proportion of the patients diagnosed with breast cancer had a short educational level (28.5 vs. 26.9%; PR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88-0.95), a low income (20.5 vs. 19.0%; PR = 0.90; 0.85-0.95) and fewer than expected in the age group 60-69 years (27.8 vs. 25.3; PR = 0.90; 0.86-0.94) were diagnosed, as compared with the pre-pandemic period. No difference in type of surgery or tumour size was observed. A higher proportion of patients received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (49.0 vs 55.0%; PR = 1.15; 1.06-1.24), whereas a lower proportion received adjuvant chemotherapy (93.5 vs 85.6%; PR = 0.92; 0.90-0.93) during the pandemic, compared with the pre-pandemic period.
CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, a small decrease in the number of breast cancer diagnoses was observed particularly among socially disadvantaged groups.

METHODS:  It is a retrospective study of cases diagnosed by a reference service in the public health system of Campinas, SP, Brazil. Two periods were analyzed: March to October 2019 (preCOVID period) and March to October 2020 (COVID-period). All women diagnosed during the periods were included. The Chi-Squared or Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests were used.
RESULTS:  In the preCOVID and COVID periods, breast cancers were diagnosed, respectively, in 115 vs 59 women, and the mean ages at diagnosis were 55 and 57 years (p = 0.339). In the COVID period, the family history of breast cancer was more observed (9.6% vs 29.8%, p < 0.001), cases were more frequently symptomatic (50.4% vs 79.7%, p < 0.001) and had more frequently palpable masses (56.5% vs 79.7%, p = 0.003). In symptomatic women, the mean number of days from symptom to mammography were 233.6 (458.3) in 2019 and 152.1 (151.5) in 2020 (p = 0.871). Among invasive tumors, the proportion of breast cancers in stages I and II was slightly higher in the COVID period, although not significantly (76.7% vs 82.4%, p = 0.428). Also in the COVID period, the frequency of luminal A-like tumors was lower (29.2% vs 11.8%, p = 0.018), of triple-negative tumors was twice as high (10.1% vs 21.6%, p = 0.062), and of estrogen receptor-positive tumors was lower (82.2% vs 66.0%, p = 0.030).
CONCLUSION:  During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer diagnoses were reduced. Cases detected were suggestive of a worse prognosis: symptomatic women with palpable masses and more aggressive subtypes.

Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the Georgetown University IRB. Review of electronic medical records identified screening mammograms and breast MRIs between March 13, 2018 and December 31, 2020, for female patients aged 18 to 85 years. Descriptive statistics characterized patterns of breast cancer screening before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses examined whether receipt of breast MRI differed over time and demographic and clinical factors associated with receipt of breast MRI in 2020.
Results: Data included 47 956 mammography visits in 32 778 patients and 407 screening breast MRI visits in 340 patients. After an initial decrease following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, both screening mammograms and screening breast MRI demonstrated early recovery. Although the mammography receipt remained sustained, the receipt of screening breast MRI decreased in late 2020. Odds of having a breast MRI did not differ between 2018 and 2019 (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 0.92%-1.25%; P = 0.384) but were significantly lower in 2020 versus 2019 (OR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.61%-0.94%; P = 0.011). No demographic or clinical factors were associated with receipt of breast MRI during the COVID-19 pandemic (all P-values ≥0.225).
Conclusion: Breast cancer screening decreased following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although both procedures demonstrated early recovery, the rebound in screening breast MRI was not sustained. Interventions promoting return to screening breast MRI may be needed for high-risk women.",,"This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (P30CA051008, Pincipal Investigator: Louis Weiner), the American Society of Preventive Oncology and Breast Cancer Research Foundation (ASPO-19–002, Principal Investigator: C.C.C.), and the American Cancer Society (ACS IRG 17–177-23, Principal Investigator: C.C.C.).",Journal of Breast Imaging,,,,2023-02-23,2023,2023-02-23,2023-05-22,5,3,277-286,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Sivanushanthan, Shankarapryan; Wu, Tianmin; Wahl, Anastacia; Li, Tengfei; Luta, George; Song, Judy H; O’Neill, Suzanne; Conley, Claire C","Sivanushanthan, Shankarapryan (Georgetown University, School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA); Wu, Tianmin (Georgetown University, Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Washington, DC, USA); Wahl, Anastacia (Georgetown University, School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA); Li, Tengfei (Georgetown University, Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Washington, DC, USA); Luta, George (Georgetown University, Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics, Washington, DC, USA); Song, Judy H (Georgetown University, Department of Radiology, Washington, DC, USA); O’Neill, Suzanne (Georgetown University, Department of Oncology, Washington, DC, USA); Conley, Claire C (Georgetown University, Department of Oncology, Washington, DC, USA)","Conley, Claire C (Georgetown University)","Sivanushanthan, Shankarapryan (Georgetown University); Wu, Tianmin (Georgetown University); Wahl, Anastacia (Georgetown University); Li, Tengfei (Georgetown University); Luta, George (Georgetown University); Song, Judy H (Georgetown University); O’Neill, Suzanne (Georgetown University); Conley, Claire C (Georgetown University)",1,1,,,https://academic.oup.com/jbi/article-pdf/5/3/277/50416466/wbad006.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155686442,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS: Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017-2021 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Cancer Registry of Norway. The crude breast cancer incidence rate (tumors per 100,000 women) during the first (March-September 2020), second (October 2020-April 2021), and Delta COVID-19 wave (May-December 2021) was compared with the incidence rate in the corresponding periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Incidence rates were stratified by age group, method of detection, and clinical tumor stage.
RESULTS: During the first wave breast cancer incidence declined to a larger extent in the Netherlands than in Norway (27.7% vs. 17.2% decrease, respectively). In both countries, incidence decreased in women eligible for screening. In the Netherlands, incidence also decreased in women not eligible for screening. During the second wave an increase in the incidence of stage IV tumors in women aged 50-69 years was seen in the Netherlands. During the Delta wave an increase in overall incidence and incidence of stage I tumors was seen in Norway.
CONCLUSION: Alterations in breast cancer incidence and tumor stage seem related to a combined effect of the suspension of the screening program, health care avoidance due to the severity of the pandemic, and other unknown factors.","Declaration of Competing Interest SS reports personal fees from the External Evaluation Committee: Public health master University of Nicosia and the Supervisory Board of PALGA (national Pathology laboratory Archive).

Although Black women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, they suffer a higher mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can be accomplished through routine screening mammography, yet the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mammography screening barriers and perception in minority communities is uncertain.MethodsFive focus group interviews were conducted as the first phase of a mixed method study across two heterogeneously diverse locations, Camden, New Jersey, and Brooklyn, New York.ResultsThirty-three women participated in this study; sixteen women were recruited at the New Jersey location and seventeen at the New York location. Only two thirds of the women stated that they had received a mammogram within the last 2 years. The major themes were binary: I get screened or I do not get screened. Subthemes were categorized as patient related or system related.ConclusionsOur findings on factors that affect breast cancer screening decisions during the COVID-19 era include barriers that are related to poverty and insurance status, as well as those that are related to medical mistrust and negative healthcare experiences.

We aimed to evaluate the pandemic's impact on overall and follow-up breast cancer screening using real-world health records data.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of women eligible for breast cancer screening through the study period from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022 using TriNetX Research Network data. We examined the temporal trend of monthly screening volume throughout the study period and compared the rate of adherence to follow-up screening within 24 months after the previous screening when the follow-up screening was due in the pre-COVID period vs the COVID period. To account for multiple screenings in the longitudinal data, we applied a logistic regression model using generalized estimating equations with adjustment for individual-level covariates.
RESULTS: Among 1,186,669 screening-eligible women, the monthly screening volume temporarily decreased by 80.6% from February to April 2020 and then rebounded to close to pre-COVID levels by June 2020. Yet, the follow-up screening rate decreased from 78.9% (95% CI, 78.8%-79.0%) in the pre-COVID period to 77.7% (95% CI, 77.6%-77.8%) in the COVID period. Multivariate regression analysis also showed a lower adherence to follow-up screening during the COVID period (odds ratio = 0.86; 0.86-0.87) and a greater pandemic impact among women aged 65 years and older and women of non-Hispanic ""other"" race (Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a transient negative effect on breast cancer screening overall and a prolonged negative effect on follow-up screening. It also exacerbated gaps in adherence to follow-up screening, especially among certain vulnerable groups, requiring innovative strategies to address potential health disparities in primary care.","The Penn State Center of Healthcare Organization Transformation Seed Grant, the Penn State College of Medicine Comprehensive Health Studies Pilot Funding program, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health (grant UL1 TR002014).",,The Annals of Family Medicine,,,Humans; COVID-19; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Middle Aged; United States; Retrospective Studies; Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Adult; Mammography; Pandemics; Mass Screening,2024-05-28,2024,2024-05-28,2024-05,22,3,208-214,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chung, Andrew; Chen, Qiushi; Curry, William; Felix, Todd; Tuan, Wen-Jan","Chung, Andrew (The Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania.); Chen, Qiushi (The Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania q.chen@psu.edu.); Curry, William (Department of Family and Community Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, Pennsylvania.); Felix, Todd (Department of Family and Community Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, Pennsylvania.); Tuan, Wen-Jan (Department of Family and Community Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, Pennsylvania.)",,"Chung, Andrew (Pennsylvania State University); Chen, Qiushi (Pennsylvania State University); Curry, William (Pennsylvania State University); Felix, Todd (Pennsylvania State University); Tuan, Wen-Jan (Pennsylvania State University)",0,0,,,https://www.annfammed.org/content/annalsfm/22/3/208.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172137330,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study aimed to describe screening mammography utilisation and the pattern of screen-detected breast cancer diagnoses following COVID-19-related screening disruptions in Ireland.
METHODS: Using anonymous aggregate data from women invited for routine screening, three time periods were examined: (1) January-December 2019, (2) January-December 2020, and (3) January-December 2021. Descriptive statistics were conducted and comparisons between groups were performed using chi-square tests.
RESULTS: In 2020, screening mammography capacity fell by 67.1% compared to 2019; recovering to 75% of mammograms performed in 2019, during 2021. Compared to 2019, for screen-detected invasive breast cancers, a reduction in Grade 1 (14.2% vs. 17.2%) and Grade 2 tumours (53.4% vs. 58.0%) and an increase in Grade 3 tumours (32.4% vs. 24.8%) was observed in 2020 (p = 0.03); whereas an increase in Grade 2 tumours (63.3% vs. 58.0%) and a reduction in Grade 3 tumours (19.6% vs. 24.8%) was found in 2021 (p = 0.02). No changes in oestrogen receptor-positive or nodal-positive diagnoses were observed; however the proportion of oestrogen/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancers significantly increased in 2020 (76.2%; p < 0.01) and 2021 (78.7%; p < 0.001) compared to 2019 (67.8%).
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate signs of a grade change for screen-detected invasive breast cancers early in the pandemic, with recovery evident in 2021, and without an increase in nodal positivity.

This included radical changes to the supply and delivery of routine services to release resources for emergency care. During this process, a range of restrictions were imposed including the recommended rules to be followed before, during and after surgery. Health services provided for breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and follow-up have also undergone enforced changes meaning the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with priority has come to the fore. In this study, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, between March 11, 2020 and May 31, 2020 was assessed in comparison to pre-pandemic practice in terms of divided into two periods, and breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Surgeons dealing with breast cancer treatment and registered to SENATURK (Turkish Senology Academy) were contacted online. The period was divided into two, between March 11th and April 30th and May 1st to May 31st, 2020. Surgeons were requested to complete two electronic evaluation forms, one for each period, investigating change in practice. Only complete responses for both periods were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: There were 93 respondents. Except for less multidisciplinary breast councils, there was no delay in radiological and pathological diagnoses. The number of breast cancer surgeries increased in Period 2, and more COVID-19 positive breast cancer patients were operated in Period 2. Benign breast patients were delayed less frequently in Period 2. In the statistical analysis performed between the two groups, it was found that only a significant difference was in the number of outpatients with benign breasts.
CONCLUSION: With sufficient awareness of the risks of COVID-19 and with individual protection, breast cancer treatment was not affected during the assessed period of active pandemic in Turkey.",,,Turkish Journal of Surgery,,,,2021-09-28,2021,2021-09-28,,37,3,222-231,All OA; Gold,Article,"Güler, Sertaç Ata; Özkan Güler, Özlem; Şimşek, Turgay; Cantürk, Nuh Zafer","Güler, Sertaç Ata (Department of General Surgery, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.); Özkan Güler, Özlem (Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.); Şimşek, Turgay (Department of General Surgery, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.); Cantürk, Nuh Zafer (Department of General Surgery, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.)",,"Güler, Sertaç Ata (Kocaeli University); Özkan Güler, Özlem (Kocaeli University); Şimşek, Turgay (Kocaeli University); Cantürk, Nuh Zafer (Kocaeli University)",2,1,0.28,0.82,https://turkjsurg.com/full-text-pdf/1793/eng,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144809368,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being
8696,pub.1156022946,,36881824,,Advanced Stage Breast Cancer on Initial Presentation Following One Year Hiatus in Screening Mammography Due to COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer death affecting women in the U.S., behind only skin and lung cancers, respectively. Modern screening mammography methods have contributed, in part, to a 40 percent decrease in breast cancer mortality since it was introduced in 1976. Therefore, regular breast cancer screening is vital to women's health. The COVID-19 Pandemic posed many challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. One challenge was the discontinuation of routine screening tests. We present a female patient who consistently participated in annual screening mammography and was confirmed negative for malignancy between 2014 and 2019. She did not get her mammogram in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was subsequently diagnosed with stage IIIB breast cancer when she resumed her screening mammogram in 2021. This case illustrates one of the consequences of delayed breast cancer screening.",,,South Dakota Medicine,,,Female; Humans; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Mammography; Pandemics; Health Services Accessibility; United States,2022-09,2022,,2022-09,75,9,396-401,Closed,Article,"Powers, Colton; Mack, Danielle; Raymond, Julie","Powers, Colton (University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Rapid City, South Dakota.); Mack, Danielle (University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Rapid City, South Dakota.); Raymond, Julie (Department of General Surgery, Rapid City Medical Center, Rapid City, South Dakota.)",,"Powers, Colton (University of South Dakota); Mack, Danielle (University of South Dakota); Raymond, Julie (Department of General Surgery, Rapid City Medical Center, Rapid City, South Dakota.)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156022946,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Focus shifted to responding to increased healthcare demand while mitigating COVID-19 spread on their campuses. Mitigation efforts limited medical professional-patient interactions, including patient access to preventive cancer screenings. Data were gleaned from a health information exchange containing records on over 2 million patients in southeastern North Carolina, USA. This study tested five hypotheses: H1: Weekly cancer screenings significantly decreased during North Carolina's (NC) Stay-At-Home (SAH) orders; H2: Weekly cancer diagnoses significantly decreased during NC's SAH orders; H3: Weekly cancer screenings significantly increased after the end of NC's SAH orders; H4: Weekly cancer diagnoses significantly increased after the end of NC's SAH orders; and H5: Weekly advanced cancer diagnoses significantly increased after the end of NC's SAH orders. Time series regression analysis was employed to quantify trends. Results suggested strong support of H1 and H3, moderate support of H4, mixed support of H5, and no support of H2. For example, compared to before the SAH orders, we estimated 662.3 fewer weekly breast cancer screenings during the SAH orders (H1). After the SAH orders (H3), we estimated 232.5 more breast cancer screenings and 10.6 more breast cancer diagnoses. This work quantifies the impact of COVID-19 associated SAH orders on cancer screenings and diagnoses and suggests the potential for delayed or missed cancer diagnoses.

Methods/operations: The Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Screening Access of Value for Essex (SAVE) program delivers cancer prevention services to the most vulnerable population in Essex County, New Jersey. The SAVE program was shut down from March 2020 to June 2020 due to COVID-19. The number of mammograms performed 18 months before the pandemic (September 2018 to March 2020) and 18 months after the shutdown of the program (July 2020 to December 2021) were recorded. A calling project was created in response to the pandemic to educate patients about COVID-19 precautions and provide healthcare and social services resources.
RESULTS: There was a 15.4% reduction in screening mammograms during the post-shutdown period (1,459 pre-COVID-19 versus 1,234 post-shutdown). The number of diagnostic mammograms increased from 264 to 272. The calling project spoke with 1,548 patients and identified the following concerns: exposure to COVID-19, language barriers, and lack of health insurance.
CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 had a profound impact on most patients, especially in the realm of breast cancer screening, the implementation of the SAVE program's strategies such as transitioning to an appointment-only system has helped minimize the negative impacts. Reaching out to the patients, partnering with community organizations, and promoting SAVE services have played a vital role in encouraging more patients to have screening done.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2023-07-23,2023,2023-07-23,2023-07-23,15,7,e42338,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lee, William J; Shah, Yash; Patel, Nidhi; Ku, Albert; Rodriguez, Anibian; Salvador, Magdalena","Lee, William J (Radiology, Rutgers University New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA.); Shah, Yash (Radiology, Rutgers University New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA.); Patel, Nidhi (Radiology, Rutgers University New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA.); Ku, Albert (Radiology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.); Rodriguez, Anibian (Radiology, Rutgers University New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA.); Salvador, Magdalena (Radiology, Rutgers University New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA.)","Lee, William J (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey)","Lee, William J (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey); Shah, Yash (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey); Patel, Nidhi (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey); Ku, Albert (Drexel University); Rodriguez, Anibian (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey); Salvador, Magdalena (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey)",1,1,,,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/168516/20230723-10904-1tmdequ.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162675779,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Monthly rates of screening mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, breast MRI, total prostate specific antigen (PSA), and breast or prostate biopsy per 1,000 people were compared by year overall, by age, and race/ethnicity. Completed procedures were identified by relevant codes in electronic health record data.ResultsRates of screening mammography, tomosynthesis, and PSA testing reached the lowest levels in April–May 2020. Breast cancer screening rates decreased 43% in March and 99% in April and May 2020, compared to 2019. Breast cancer screening rates increased gradually beginning in June 2020 through 2021, although more slowly in Black and Hispanic women and in women aged 75–85. PSA testing rates decreased 34% in March, 78% in April, and 53% in May 2020, but rebounded to pre-pandemic levels by June 2020; trends were similar across groups defined by age and race/ethnicity.ConclusionThe observed decline in two common screening procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects the impact of the pandemic on cancer early detection and signals potential downstream effects on the prognosis of delayed cancer diagnoses. The slower rate of return for breast cancer screening procedures in certain subgroups should be investigated to ensure all women return for routine screenings.",The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of Mary Charpentier and Wendy Macleod from Reliant Medical Group and thank them for their assistance with this project.,"This work was supported by funding from Reliant Medical Group and The Meyers Health Care Institute, a joint endeavor of the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Fallon Health, and Reliant Medical Group (formerly the Meyers Primary Care Institute).",Cancer Causes & Control,,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Male; Mammography; Mass Screening; Pandemics; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms",2022-08-06,2022,2022-08-06,2022-10,33,10,1313-1323,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Epstein, Mara M.; Sundaresan, Devi; Fair, Meagan; Fouayzi, Hassan; Warner, Erica T.; Garber, Lawrence D.; Gurwitz, Jerry H.; Field, Terry S.","Epstein, Mara M.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare delivery throughout North America. Breast cancer diagnosis and management was similarly affected.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to determine the impact of COVID-19 on BC care and the impact on patients' well-being.
RESULTS: Our review found that the pandemic led to changes in screenings, biopsies, medical therapy, and surgery. Constraints of the pandemic left patients without resources to navigate the emotional toll from social distancing. There was a disparity in patients' perceptions of the impact of the pandemic on BC care.
CONCLUSION: Although the pandemic altered medical care in general, we found that the impact on breast cancer care was counterintuitively not as significant as predicted. However, the pandemic did impact breast cancer patients' mental well-being. This highlights the importance of properly communicating, in real-time, guidelines on breast cancer management to allay the fears of the general public.","Declaration of competing interest The authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that they have NO affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers’ bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements), or non-financial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.",,The American Journal of Surgery,,,Humans; Female; United States; COVID-19; Pandemics; Breast Neoplasms; Delivery of Health Care; North America,2022-08-03,2022,2022-08-03,2022-11,224,5,1222-1228,All OA; Green,Article,"Kripalani, Simran; Kulshreshta, Srishti; Saracco, Benjamin; Meterissian, Sarkis","Kripalani, Simran (Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Camden, NJ, USA.

This study aims to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization of essential health services in Iran.MethodsAn analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using interrupted time series (ITS) analysis. Data about five indicators, including 'childhood vaccination, infant care, hypertension screening, diabetes screening, and breast cancer screening,' were obtained from the electronic health record System in two-time intervals: 15 months before (November 2018 to January 2020) and 15 months after (January 2020 to May 2021) the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were analyzed by utilizing ITS. In addition, a Poisson model was employed due to the usage of count data. The Durbin-Watson (DW) test was used to identify the presence of lag-1 autocorrelation in the time series data. All statistical analysis was performed using R 4.3.1 software, considering a 5% significance level.ResultsThe ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the utilization of all essential health services (P < 0.0001). The utilization of hypertension screening (RR = 0.51, p < 0.001), diabetes screening (RR = 0.884, p < 0.001), breast cancer screening (RR = 0.435, p < 0.001), childhood vaccination (IRR = 0.947, p < 0.001), and infant care (RR = 1.666, p < 0.001), exhibited a significant decrease in the short term following the pandemic (P < 0.0001). However, the long-term trend for all service utilization, except breast cancer screening (IRR = 0.952, p < 0.001), demonstrated a significant increase.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic affected utilization of essential health care in Iran. It is imperative to utilize this evidence to develop policies that will be translated into targeted planning and implementation to sustain provision and utilization of essential health services during public health emergencies.

METHODS: We fielded a 52-item web-based questionnaire from 14 May 2020 to 1 July 2020 in partnership with several U.S.-based breast cancer advocacy groups. Individuals aged 18 or older were eligible for this study if they: (1) received routine breast cancer screening; OR (2) were undergoing diagnostic evaluation for breast cancer; OR (3) had ever been diagnosed with breast cancer. We used descriptive statistics to understand the extent of cancer care delay and telemedicine adoption and used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the association of sociodemographic factors with odds of COVID-19-related delays in care and telemedicine use.
RESULTS: Of 554 eligible survey participants, 493 provided complete data on demographic and socioeconomic factors and were included in the analysis. Approximately half (n = 248, 50.3%) had a personal history of breast cancer. Overall, 188 (38.1%) participants had experienced any COVID-19-related delay in care including screening, diagnosis, or treatment, and 339 (68.8) reported having at least one virtual appointment during the study period. Compared to other insurance types, participants with Medicaid insurance were 2.58 times more likely to report a COVID-19-related delay in care (OR 2.58, 95% Cl: 1.05, 6.32; p = 0.039). Compared to participants with a household income of less than USD 50,000, those with a household income of USD 150,000 or more were 2.38 (OR 2.38, 95% Cl: 1.09, 5.17; p = 0.029) times more likely to adopt virtual appointments. Self-insured participants were 70% less likely to use virtual appointment compared to those in other insurance categories (OR 0.28, 95% Cl: 0.11, 0.73; p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and accelerated the delivery of virtual care. Lower-income groups and patients with certain insurance categories such as Medicaid or self-insured could be more likely to experience care delay or less likely to use telemedicine. Careful attention must be paid to vulnerable groups to insure equity in breast cancer-related service utilization and telemedicine access during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",We thank Michelle Sodipo and Audra Hite for their administrative assistance with the manuscript.,This research received no external funding.,Current Oncology,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Telemedicine; Time-to-Treatment; United States,2022-08-20,2022,2022-08-20,,29,8,5919-5932,All OA; Gold,Article,"Du, Simo; Carfang, Laura; Restrepo, Emily; Benjamin, Christine; Epstein, Mara M.; Fairley, Ricki; Roudebush, Laura; Hertz, Crystal; Eshraghi, Leah; Warner, Erica T.","Du, Simo (SurvivingBreastCancer.org, Boston, MA 02119, USA); Carfang, Laura (SurvivingBreastCancer.org, Boston, MA 02119, USA); Restrepo, Emily (Mongan Institute, Clinical Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA); Benjamin, Christine (SHARE Cancer Support, New York, NY 10036, USA); Epstein, Mara M.

METHODS: From August 2020 to March 2021, 3691 female residents of British Columbia (age 25-69 y) participated in this study. We used generalized estimating equations to analyze the proportion of females accessing contraception and the proportion having difficulty accessing contraception across the different phases of pandemic control measures, and logistic regression to analyze attendance at cervical and breast cancer screening. We added sociodemographic and biological variables individually into the models. Self-reported barriers to accessing contraception and attending screening were summarized.
RESULTS: During phases with the highest pandemic controls, self-reported access to contraception was lower (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.90-0.98; P = 0.005) and difficulty with access was higher (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.54-4.88; P = 0.001). A higher proportion of adults aged 25-34 years reported difficulty accessing contraception than those aged 35-39 years (P < 0.0001), and participants identifying as Indigenous had higher odds of access difficulties (OR 5.56; 95% CI 2.44-12.50; P < 0.001). Of those who required screening during the COVID-19 pandemic, 62% and 54.5% did not attend at least one of their cervical or breast screening appointments, respectively. Those with a history of breast cancer had significantly higher odds of self-reporting having attended their mammogram appointment compared with those without a history of breast cancer (OR 5.62; 95% CI 2.69-13.72; P < 0.001). The most common barriers to screening were difficulty getting an appointment and appointments being considered non-urgent.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has uniquely affected access to contraception and cancer screening participation for various subgroups. Self-reported data present potential avenues for mitigating barriers.",The authors wish to thank Falla Jin at the BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute for her assistance with data collection.,Disclosures: Funding for this project was from a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Grant (19055) and a BC Women's Health Foundation Grant (LRZ30421) both awarded to Dr. Lori A.

This study aimed to assess the pandemic impact on the trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and breast cancer stage at diagnosis according to age-group.
METHODS: This was an ecological time series study by inflection point regression model. We used data from women aged between 30 and 49, 50 and 69, and 70 years or more available in an open-access dataset of the Brazilian public healthcare system (2017-2021). We analyzed the trend of the variables in the pre-pandemic and the pandemic effect on the total time series.
RESULTS: The decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms in the pre-pandemic has changed to a decreasing trend in the total time series in all age-groups. Before the pandemic, the increasing trend of breast biopsies has changed to stationary in the total time series in all age-groups. The increasing trend of tumors at stages 0 to II in the pre-pandemic has changed to decreasing or stationary in the total time series. Finally, the increasing trend of tumors at stage III or IV remained increasing in the total time series in all age-groups.
CONCLUSION: The pandemic has changed the stationary or increasing trend to a decreasing or stationary trend of mammograms, breast biopsies, and tumors at stages 0 to II but has not influenced the increasing trend of tumors at stages III and IV in all age-groups.",,"The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) experienced significant hardship, but generally have greater access to preventive services, making them a particularly relevant population in which to understand cancer screening behaviors during the pandemic. We report data from 794 HCWs enrolled in the NCI-funded Serological Sciences Network for Coronavirus Associations and Longitudinal Evaluation Study from December 2020 to April 2021. Participants reported lifestyle and screening behaviors during relevant look-back periods which included the pandemic timeframe. Among women between the ages of 40 and 74, 25.7% were overdue for mammographic breast cancer screening. Among participants 50-75 years old, 38.9% were overdue for colorectal cancer screening. The proportion over-due varied according to race/ethnicity. Lifetime low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening among HCWs age 50-80 years who were smokers was 10.9%. Strategies to address screening disruptions are needed to minimize the impact of later stage of diagnosis.","We are grateful to all the front-line healthcare workers in our healthcare system who continue to be dedicated to delivering the highest quality care for all patients.

8305,pub.1168331947,10.1007/s10552-023-01847-z,38280155,,Breast and cervical cancer screenings across gender identity: results from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"PurposeAlthough national medical organizations often neglect to include trans and gender diverse (TGD) people in their breast and cervical cancer screening recommendations, the World Profession Association of Transgender Health recommends that TGD people who are at risk for these cancers follow existing guidelines for cisgender women. Despite WPATH’s recommendations, TGD people are less likely to get screened in large part due to discrimination. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited access to cancer screenings among cisgender people, but it is unknown how this has impacted TGD people.MethodsUsing national survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS), we examined differences in cervical and breast cancer screening noncompliance across gender identity at two time points: before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.ResultsScreening noncompliance increased during the COVID-19 pandemic among cisgender and TGD people (e.g., transgender men, gender non-conforming people). Compared to cisgender women, transgender men and gender non-conforming respondents had higher odds of breast cancer screening noncompliance before and during COVID-19. Transgender men had lower odds of cervical cancer screening noncompliance than cisgender women before COVID-19, but higher odds during the pandemic. Gender non-conforming respondents also had lower odds of cervical cancer screening noncompliance during COVID-19 compared to cisgender women.ConclusionsScreening noncompliance for breast and cervical cancer was more common among TGD people than cisgender women; while these disparities existed before the COVID-19 pandemic, they were exacerbated during the pandemic.

While breast cancer screening participation is the most effective method for early detection, screening rate has remained low. Given that understanding health perception is critical to understand health decisions, our study utilized the Health Belief Model-based deep learning method to predict and examine public health beliefs in breast cancer and its screening behavior. The results showed that the trends in public health perception are sensitive to political (i.e., changes in health policy), sociological (i.e., representation of disease and its preventive care by public figure or organization), psychological (i.e., social support), and environmental factors (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic).

Using administrative claims data from PR's Medicaid population, this study assessed trends in colorectal and breast cancer screening from 2016 to 2021, the impact of disasters in screening, and the absolute deficit in screening due to the pandemic. The monthly rates of claims were analyzed using Poisson regression. Significant reductions in breast and colorectal cancer screening utilization were observed. The colorectal cancer screening rate in 2017 was 77% lower a month after Hurricanes Irma and María [RRadj: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.25] compared to the same time period in 2016. Breast cancer screening dropped 50% in November 2017 compared to November 2016 [RRadj: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.54]. Prospectively, a recovery in utilization has been observed only for breast cancer screening. The results revealed that cancer screening utilization substantially declined after environmental disasters and the pandemic. These findings have potentially severe long-term implications for cancer health disparities and mortality in PR.","The authors thank our partners for their support.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused innumerable hardships, panic, and restrictions of movement which negatively affected the assessment of healthcare services like breast cancer diagnosis in many countries. The results from the histopathological diagnosis of breast tumours have been routinely employed for the treatment and management of these diseases. This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the histopathological diagnosis of breast tumours in Calabar. A retrospective study of the newly diagnosed breast tumours recorded in the Histopathology Laboratory register during the COVID-19 and the post-COVID-19 recovery from January 2020-February 2021 was compared with cases diagnosed before the pandemic from January 2018 to February 2019. Descriptive and inferential statistics and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) were used for data analysis. New breast tumours diagnosed based on month showed low rates of 2.4% and 1.2% during the first and second waves of the pandemic respectively. The diagnosed cases increased to 11.8% and 8.2% after the first and second waves of the virus respectively. There was a significantly strong negative correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures with breast tumour diagnosis (r=-0.919, p=0.001). More benign tumours of 56(58.3%) cases with a mean age of 25.3±11.1 years were recorded before the pandemic and were statistically significant (F=64.260, p=0.004). More malignant cases of 48(57.1%) with a mean age of 47.5±11.7 years were recorded during the pandemic. The diagnosis of malignant tumours was statistically significant between both periods (F=183.550, p=0.001). The ANN model predicted a 25% reduction in breast tumour diagnosis during the pandemic. There was a 100% impact of the pandemic on tumour type, the nature of specimen, and mean age of subjects. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the assessment of healthcare services as a smaller number of women were diagnosed with breast tumours during the period. This may have caused delays and late presentation leading to the diagnosis of more malignant tumours. There is a need to put adequate measures to encourage the assessment of diagnostic services during pandemics as delays may lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality.",,,Nigerian Journal of Physiological Sciences,,,Humans; Female; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; COVID-19; Pandemics; Nigeria; Retrospective Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19 Testing,2023-06-30,2023,2023-06-30,,38,1,23-28,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Udonkang, Mfoniso; Umoh, Nse; Ogba, Ofonime; Bebia, Glory; Onwineng, David; Anku, Blessing; Ernest, Naomi","Udonkang, Mfoniso (UNIVERSITY OF CALABAR. mfonisotoday10@yahoo.com.); Umoh, Nse (Department of Medical Bacteriology, Virology and Mycology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria. nsirumoh1611@gmail.com.); Ogba, Ofonime (Department of Medical Bacteriology, Virology and Mycology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria. ofonimemark@yahoo.com.); Bebia, Glory (Department of Medical Bacteriology, Virology and Mycology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria. blingberryg30@gmail.com.); Onwineng, David (Department of Histopathology and Cytology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria. daveasuquo560@gmail.com.); Anku, Blessing (Department of Histopathology and Cytology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria. blessinganku428@gmail.com.); Ernest, Naomi (Histopathology Laboratory, University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, Nigeria. ernestnaomi32@gmail.com.)",,"Udonkang, Mfoniso (University of Calabar); Umoh, Nse (University of Calabar); Ogba, Ofonime (University of Calabar); Bebia, Glory (University of Calabar); Onwineng, David (University of Calabar); Anku, Blessing (University of Calabar); Ernest, Naomi (University of Calabar)",0,0,,,https://ojshostng.com/index.php/njphysiologicalsciences/article/download/2780/1920,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168099027,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

We propose a pragmatic management approach based on clinical presentation, vaccination delivery, and imaging findings. In the settings of screening mammography, screening MRI, and diagnostic imaging workup of breast symptoms, with no imaging findings beyond unilateral axillary adenopathy ipsilateral to recent (within the past 6 weeks) vaccination, we report the adenopathy as benign with no further imaging indicated if no nodes are palpable 6 weeks after the last dose. For patients with palpable axillary adenopathy in the setting of ipsilateral recent vaccination, clinical follow-up of the axilla is recommended. In all these scenarios, axillary ultrasound is recommended if clinical concern persists 6 weeks after vaccination. In patients with a recent breast cancer diagnosis in the pre- or peritreatment setting, prompt recommended imaging is encouraged as well as vaccination (in the thigh or contralateral arm). Our recommendations align with the ACR BI-RADS Atlas and aim to reduce patient anxiety, provider burden, and costs of unnecessary evaluation of enlarged nodes in the setting of recent vaccinations and, also, to avoid further delays in vaccinations and breast cancer screening during the pandemic.",,,American Journal of Roentgenology,,,Axilla; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19 Vaccines; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Lymph Nodes; Lymphadenopathy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mammography; Ultrasonography; Vaccination,2021-07-22,2021,2021-07-22,2021-09,217,3,584-586,Closed,Article,"Lehman, Constance D; Lamb, Leslie R; D'Alessandro, Helen Anne","Lehman, Constance D (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Wang 240, Boston, MA 02114-2696.); Lamb, Leslie R (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Wang 240, Boston, MA 02114-2696.); D'Alessandro, Helen Anne (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Wang 240, Boston, MA 02114-2696.)",,"Lehman, Constance D (Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University); Lamb, Leslie R (Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University); D'Alessandro, Helen Anne (Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University)",58,12,3.35,21.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135671388,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Early detection through mammogram screening is instrumental in reducing mortality and incidence of disease. The COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to the provision of care, including delays in preventive screenings. We examined trends in breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic in a universally insured national population and evaluated rates across racial groups and socioeconomic strata.
METHODS: In this retrospective open cohort study, we used the Military Health System Data Repository to identify female TRICARE beneficiaries ages 40-64 at average risk for breast cancer between FY2018 and FY2022, broken down into prepandemic (September 1, 2018-February 28, 2020), early pandemic (March 1, 2020-September 30, 2020), and late pandemic periods (October 1, 2020-September 30, 2022). The primary outcome was receipt of breast cancer screening.
RESULTS: Screening dropped 74% in the early pandemic period and 22% in the late pandemic period, compared with the prepandemic period. Compared with White women, Asian/Pacific Islander women were less likely to receive mammograms during the late pandemic period (0.92RR; 0.90-0.93 95%CI). American Indian/Alaska Native women remained less likely to receive screenings compared with White women during the early (0.87RR; 0.80-0.94 95% CI) and late pandemic (0.94RR, 0.91-0.98 95% CI). Black women had a higher likelihood of screenings during both the early pandemic (1.10RR; 1.08-1.12 95% CI) and late pandemic (1.12RR, 1.11-1.13 95% CI) periods compared with White women. During the early and late pandemic periods, disparities by rank persisted from prepandemic levels, with a decrease in likelihood of screenings across all sponsor ranks.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the influence of race and socioeconomics on mammography screening during COVID-19. Targeted outreach and further evaluation of factors underpinning lower utilization in these populations are necessary to improve access to preventative services across the population.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare they have no conflicts of interest.,"This work was funded by the Department of Defense, Defense Health Agency (award #HU0012120089).",Cancer Medicine,,,,2023-08-28,2023,2023-08-28,2023-09,12,18,19126-19136,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mani, Vivitha; Banaag, Amanda; Munigala, Satish; Umoh, Ada; Schoenfeld, Andrew J.; Coles, Christian L.; Koehlmoos, Tracey Perez","Mani, Vivitha (Center for Health Services Research, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, USA; The Henry M.

Outcomes included time from biopsy to consultation and treatment. Comparisons were made using Chi-square or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.ResultsFewer new breast cancers were diagnosed in 2020 during the SiP period than during a similar period in 2019 (n = 247 vs n = 703). A higher percentage presented with symptomatic disease in 2020 than 2019 (78% vs 37%, p < 0.001). Higher percentages of 2020 patients presented with grade 3 (37% vs 25%, p = 0.004) and triple-negative tumors (16% vs 10%, p = 0.04). A smaller percentage underwent surgery first in 2020 (71% vs 83%, p < 0.001) and a larger percentage had neoadjuvant chemotherapy (16% vs 11%, p < 0.001). Telehealth utilization increased from 0.8% in 2019 to 70.0% in 2020. Times to surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were shorter in 2020 than 2019 (19 vs 26 days, p < 0.001, and 23 vs 28 days, p = 0.03, respectively).ConclusionsDuring SiP, fewer breast cancers were diagnosed than during a similar period in 2019, and a higher proportion presented with symptomatic disease. Early-stage breast cancer diagnoses decreased, while metastatic cancer diagnoses remained similar. Telehealth increased significantly, and times to treatment were shorter in 2020 than 2019.

We estimated the potential impact on breast cancer mortality using long-term global observations. However, the magnitude of the impact may vary across countries; therefore, we conducted an analysis and modeling study of this impact in Japan.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the clinicopathological features of breast cancers between the nonpandemicgroup (April 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019) and the pandemic group (April 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020). We also compared the estimated 10-year survival rates between the two groups based on the weighted average of the 10-year survival rate by clinical stage and site (2004-2007).
RESULTS: Results...Pandemic-related disruption decreased the number of breast cancer cases from296 to 249 during both 7-month periods. The percentage of patients with stage IIB or higher disease was significantly higher in the pandemic group than in the non-pandemic group (22.0% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.0133). The percentage of cases with a Ki-67 labeling index higher than 20% tended to be higher in the pandemic group than in the non-pandemic group (62.2% vs. 54.4%). The estimated 10-year survival rate was lower in the pandemic group than in the non-pandemic group (83.9% vs. 87.9%, 95% confidence interval of the difference: 0.87-8.8, P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We found more aggressive and advanced disease afterthe suspension of breast cancer screening services owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. This may have affected the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with breast cancer.","Acknowledgements

8177,pub.1146253430,10.37765/ajmc.2022.88855,35285592,,Considerations to increase rates of breast cancer screening across populations.,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has caused considerable drops in utilization of breast cancer screening services during the pandemic, especially among certain racial and ethnic groups. Members of the Community Oncology Alliance (COA)-including the COA president, South Carolina oncologist Kashyap Patel, MD-have reported increases in patients, particularly those of color, presenting with stage III and IV cancer at diagnosis. According to data released by the Biden administration, more than 9.5 million recommended cancer screenings had been missed in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of February 2022. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, EdD, aim to address this in the 2022 revitalized Cancer Moonshot Initiative. The findings made by COA as well as by Avalere also suggest that the pandemic has exacerbated existing health care disparities.
METHODS: Using a multipayer database, we analyzed breast cancer screening rates for 2 periods-March 1 to September 30, 2019, and March 1 to September 30, 2020-among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), managed Medicaid, and commercial insurance beneficiaries to understand the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adherence to the US Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening recommendations, which are currently undergoing review. Screening rates were evaluated across 5 racial/ethnic groups and by payer type.
RESULTS: Mean monthly mammogram screening rates among eligible White Medicare FFS beneficiaries dropped to 0.6% in April 2020, but these screening rates recovered to 6.5% by June 2020. Screening rates for eligible Black Medicare FFS beneficiaries recovered on a pace slightly slower than that of White beneficiaries, but more rapidly than that of other groups. By comparison, American Indian/Alaska Native beneficiaries had a mean monthly screening rate of 0.5% in April 2020, which recovered to 3.1% in June 2020; these were below 2019 screening rates of 4.2% for April and 3.9% for June. Differences in screening rates by payer type were also observed. Patients with commercial insurance had higher screening rates compared with those covered by Medicare FFS and managed Medicaid.
CONCLUSIONS: Our principal finding shows that mean breast cancer screening rates decreased in April 2020 across all payers, but recovery to prepandemic screening levels has occurred more slowly among certain racial and ethnic minority groups. Differences in recovery rates by payer type highlight a strong relationship between income level and screening utilization.",,,The American Journal of Managed Care,,,Aged; Female; Humans; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Ethnicity; Medicare; Minority Groups; Pandemics; United States,2022-03-14,2022,2022-03-14,2022-04-01,28,3 Spec.

Mammograms are one of the main early diagnosis strategies. National breast cancer screening coverage is still low. Brazil’s low screening coverage is due to high mammography access inequality. Skin color defines healthcare access differences. Our article explores the natural event of the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze differences in screening rates between two racial groups of women through the application of the differences in differences (DiD) estimator. The results indicate that BBI women (Black, Brown, and Indigenous Brazilian) have lower screening rates than WY women (White and Yellow) and that the pandemic reduced the difference between these two groups due to the lower number of mammograms performed by WY women. It is believed that the information channel can explain much of this result. The BA population, wealthier and more educated, may have had additional information about COVID-19 and its consequences, as well as an increased likelihood of working remotely and practicing social distance. Structural racism causes many social indicators to be correlated with inequality of access to mammography and negatively impacts health conditions for BBI women.

This study aims to analyze the changes in the rates of screening mammograms and BIRADS 4 or 5 mammograms during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the opportunistic scenario.
METHODS: We integrated three different public databases from the state of São Paulo, Brazil, to obtain the rate of screening mammograms per 1,000, and the rate of BIRADS 4 or 5 mammograms per 100,000 women aged from 50 to 69 years in the years from January 2017 to December 2020.
RESULTS: The mean monthly screening mammograms decreased from 14.8/1,000 in 2019 to 9.25/1,000 in 2020, with the lowest rates being recorded in May 2020 (3.1/1,000). The mean monthly high-risk mammograms decreased from 12.8/100,000 in 2019 to 9.1/100,000 in 2020, with the lowest rates being recorded in April 2020 (4.3/100,000).

This study examined changes in 2022 compared to 2018 in the national prevalence of self-reported up-to-date mammography.
METHODS: Using 2018-2022 data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we assess relative changes defined as annual prevalence ratios (aPR) in the SR receipt of past-year and up-to-date (UTD) breast cancer screening (bi-annual mammography in women ages 50-74 years) during the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic overall and by sociodemographic characteristics.
RESULTS: UTD BC screening declined for the first time since 2018 (2018 compared to 2022, from 78.7% to 76.6%; aPR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.98), despite a small increase in past-year breast cancer screening from 2020 and 2022 (57.9% to 59.6%; aPR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05). This translated to 747,791 fewer women reporting UTD with recommended BC screening in 2022 vs. 2018. UTD BC screening declines between 2018-2022 were largest for American Indian/Alaska Native women (74.8% to 62.2%; aPR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93), women with less formal educational attainment (< high school: 73.1% to 65.5%; aPR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95), and women without a usual source of care (48% to 42.9%; aPR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Previously noted pandemic-related declines in past-year BC screening now reflect in women reporting being UTD, with the largest declines in AI/AN and lower SES women.

Screening mammography, a cornerstone of breast cancer control and prevention, was completely halted in the spring of 2020, and screening programs have continued to face challenges with subsequent COVID-19 waves. Although screening mammography rates decreased for all women during the pandemic, a number of studies have now clearly documented that reductions in screening have been greater for some populations than others. Specifically, minoritized women have been screened at lower rates than White women across studies, although the specific patterns of disparity vary depending on the populations and communities studied. We posit that these disparities are likely due to a variety of structural and contextual factors, including the differential impact of COVID-19 on communities. We also outline key considerations for closing gaps in screening mammography. First, practices, health systems, and communities must measure screening mammography use to identify whether gaps exist and which populations are most affected. Second, we propose that strategies to close disparities in breast cancer screening must be multifaceted, targeting the health system or practice, but also structural factors at the policy level.

More than 20 years ago, we proposed that zoonotic transmission of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) from the western European house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, might account for the regional differences in breast cancer incidence. In the intervening years, several developments provide additional support for this hypothesis, including the limited impact of genetic factors for breast cancer susceptibility revealed by genome-wide association studies and the strong effect of antiretroviral therapy to reduce breast cancer incidence. At the same time, economic globalization has further expanded the distribution of M. m. domesticus to Asia, leading to a significant increase in breast cancer incidence in this region. Here, we revisit this evidence and provide an update to the MMTV zoonotic hypothesis for human breast cancer at a time when the world is recovering from the global COVID-19 zoonotic pandemic. We present evidence that mouse population outbreaks are correlated with spikes in breast cancer incidence in Australia and New Zealand and that globalization has increased the range of M. m. domesticus and MMTV. Given the success of global vaccination campaigns for HPV to eradicate cervical cancer, a similar strategy for MMTV may be warranted. Until breast cancer incidence is reduced by such an approach, zoonotic transmission of MMTV from mice to humans as an etiologic factor for breast cancer will remain controversial.",,,Viruses,,,"Animals; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Incidence; Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse; Mice",2022-03-09,2022,2022-03-09,,14,3,559,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stewart, Alexandre F R; Chen, Hsiao-Huei","Stewart, Alexandre F R (Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Ruddy Canadian Cardiovascular Genetics Centre, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4W7, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.; Centre for Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.); Chen, Hsiao-Huei (Centre for Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.; Brain and Mind Institute, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.; Neuroscience Division, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.)","Stewart, Alexandre F R (University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa); Chen, Hsiao-Huei (University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital; Ottawa Hospital)","Stewart, Alexandre F R (University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa); Chen, Hsiao-Huei (University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital; Ottawa Hospital)",13,6,2.63,3.88,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/3/559/pdf?version=1647226607,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146170886,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,

Axillary lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination has been frequently reported. This may cause a diagnostic dilemma, particularly in the ipsilateral axilla in women who have a either a recent diagnosis of breast cancer or a history of breast cancer. This review provides an overview of the current evidence regarding axillary lymph node characteristics at breast cancer diagnosis versus ""post-COVID-19 vaccination"".
METHODS: A non-systematic narrative review was performed. Studies describing axillary lymph node characteristics per imaging modality (axillary US, breast MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT) in breast cancer patients versus post-COVID-19 vaccination were selected and used for the current study.
RESULTS: The morphologic characteristics and distribution of abnormal nodes on US may differ from the appearance of metastatic adenopathy since diffuse cortical thickening of the lymph nodes is the most observed characteristic after vaccination, whereas metastases show as most suspicious characteristics focal cortical thickening and effacement of the fatty hilum. Current evidence on MRI and 18F-FDG on morphologic characteristics of axillary lymphadenopathy is missing, although it was suggested that vaccine related lymphadenopathy is more likely to be present in level 2 and 3 nodes than metastatic nodes. Reported frequencies of lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination range from 49% to 85% (US), 29% (breast MRI) and 14.5% to 53.9% (18F-FDG PET/CT). Several factors may impact the presence or extent of lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination: injection site, type of vaccine (i.e., mRNA versus vector), time interval (days) between vaccination and imaging, previous history of COVID-19 pneumonia, and first versus second vaccine dose.

Purpose of Review
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented challenges on breast cancer patients and health care providers. The impact of the pandemic on preexisting breast cancer disparities remains unknown but is projected to have adverse outcomes.Recent FindingsEarly work has demonstrated that pandemic-related temporary suspensions in breast cancer screening, interruption of clinical trials, and treatment delays have an adverse impact on breast cancer patient outcomes and may worsen disparities.SummaryIn this review, we highlight existing knowledge regarding breast cancer disparities and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies for mitigating disparities moving forward include targeted research evaluating race-specific outcomes, targeted education for providers regarding breast health disparities, improved access to telehealth, maintenance of patient navigation programs, and patient education regarding the safety and necessity of enrollment in clinical trials.",We acknowledge the expertise and support of the librarians of the Weill Cornell Medicine Samuel J.

METHODS: Screening and diagnostic mammographic examinations, biopsies performed, and cancer diagnoses were extracted from the ACR National Mammography Database from March 1, 2019, through May 31, 2021. Patient (race and age) and facility (regional location, community type, and facility type) demographics were collected. Three time periods were used for analysis: pre-COVID-19 (March 1, 2019, to May 31, 2019), peak COVID-19 (March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020), and COVID-19 recovery (March 1, 2021, to May 31, 2021). Analysis was performed at the facility level and overall between time periods.
RESULTS: In total, 5,633,783 screening mammographic studies, 1,282,374 diagnostic mammographic studies, 231,390 biopsies, and 69,657 cancer diagnoses were analyzed. All peak COVID-19 metrics were less than pre-COVID-19 volumes: 36.3% of pre-COVID-19 for screening mammography, 57.9% for diagnostic mammography, 47.3% for biopsies, and 48.7% for cancer diagnoses. There was some rebound during COVID-19 recovery as a percentage of pre-COVID-19 volumes: 85.3% of pre-COVID-19 for screening mammography, 97.8% for diagnostic mammography, 91.5% for biopsies, and 92.0% for cancer diagnoses. Across various metrics, there was a disproportionate negative impact on older women, Asian women, facilities in the Northeast, and facilities affiliated with academic medical centers.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had the greatest impact on screening mammography volumes, which have not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. Cancer diagnoses declined significantly in the acute phase and have not fully rebounded, emphasizing the need to increase outreach efforts directed at specific patient population and facility types.",The authors thank ACR staff members for assistance in preparation of the NMD data and acknowledge guidance and input by the NMD Steering Committee for this analysis.,,Journal of the American College of Radiology,,,Aged; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Mass Screening; Pandemics,2022-06-08,2022,2022-06-08,2022-08,19,8,919-934,All OA; Green,Article,"Grimm, Lars J; Lee, Cindy; Rosenberg, Robert D; Burleson, Judy; Simanowith, Michael; Fruscello, Tom; Pelzl, Casey E; Friedewald, Sarah M; Moy, Linda; Zuley, Margarita L","Grimm, Lars J (Department of Radiology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Vice Chair, National Mammography Database.

Chi-square statistical comparisons of detection method (patient (PtD)/mammography (MamD), Stage (0-IV) and treatment by pre-pandemic time 1: 2019 + Q1 2020; peak-pandemic time 2: Q2-Q4 2020; pandemic time 3: Q1-Q4 2021 (Q = quarter) periods and logistic regression for odds ratios were used.ResultsBC case volume decreased 22% in 2020 (N = 533) (p = .001). MamD declined from 64% pre-pandemic to 58% peak-pandemic, and increased to 71% in 2021 (p < .001). PtD increased from 30 to 36% peak-pandemic and declined to 25% in 2021 (p < .001). Diagnosis of Stage 0/I BC declined peak-pandemic when screening mammography was curtailed due to lock-down mandates but rebounded above pre-pandemic levels in 2021. In adjusted regression, peak-pandemic stage 0/I BC diagnosis decreased 24% (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.96, p = .021) and increased 34% in 2021 (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.70, p = .014). Peak-pandemic neoadjuvant therapy increased from 33 to 38% (p < .001), primarily for surgical delay cases.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic restricted health-care access, reduced mammography screening and created surgical delays. During the peak-pandemic time, due to restricted or no access to mammography screening, we observed a decrease in stage 0/I BC by number and proportion. Continued low case numbers represent a need to re-establish screening behavior and staffing.",,This study was supported the Kaplan Cancer Research Fund.,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,,,Humans; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Mammography; Retrospective Studies; Pandemics; Early Detection of Cancer; Mass Screening; Neoplasm Staging; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Breast Carcinoma In Situ; COVID-19 Testing,2023-08-16,2023,2023-08-16,2023-11,202,1,105-115,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Malmgren, Judith A.; Guo, Boya; Atwood, Mary K.; Hallam, Paula; Roberts, Laura A.; Kaplan, Henry G.","Malmgren, Judith A.

Emergency departments (ED) may be a novel place for cancer screening education for underserved patients. In this study we sought to determine patient characteristics and barriers to cancer screening for those patients who presented to a large, academic safety-net ED and were overdue for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening since the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Methods: Adult ED patients eligible for at least one cancer screening based on US Preventive Serivces Task Force guidelines completed a web-based survey. We examined the association of demographic characteristics and having a personal physician with being overdue on screening using chi-square or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.
Results: Of 221 participants, 144 were eligible for colorectal, 96 for cervical, and 55 for breast cancer screening. Of eligible patients, 46% (25/55) were overdue for breast cancer screening, 43% (62/144) for colorectal, and 40% (38/96) for cervical cancer screening. There were no significant characteristics associated with breast cancer screening. Being overdue for cervical cancer screening was significantly more likely for patients who were of Asian race (P = 0.02), had less than a high school diploma (P = 0.01), and were without a routine checkup within the prior five years (P = 0.01). Overdue for colorectal cancer screening was associated with patients not having insurance (P = 0.04), being in their 40s (P = 0.03), being Hispanic (P = 0.01), and not having a primary care physician (P=0.01). Of 97 patients overdue for at least one screening, the most common barriers were cost (37%), lack of time (37%), and lack of knowledge of screening recommendations (34%). Only 8.3% reported that the COVID-19 pandemic delayed their screening.
Conclusion: The ED may be a novel setting to target patients for cancer screening education. Future work that refers patients to free screening programs and primary care physicians may help improve disparities in cancer screening and cancer mortality rates for underserved populations.",,,Western Journal of Emergency Medicine,,,"Adult; Female; Humans; Early Detection of Cancer; Pandemics; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Service, Hospital; Breast Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms",2024-01-04,2024,2024-01-04,2024-01,0,0,101-110,All OA; Gold,Article,"Heinert, Sara W.; Ahmed, Mohammed; Guzman-Baez, Kelvin; Penugonda, Ananya; Oh, Sarah; Aamir, Affan; Ferrante, Jeanne M.","Heinert, Sara W.

METHODS: To better understand the changes to detection and treatment of breast cancer at our institution, we analyzed mammogram rates (screening and diagnostic) and breast cancer operations in 2019-2020. Mammography rates were calculated using county level census data for eligible women (Z-test). For breast cancer staging, a stage severity score was analyzed with a Mann-Whitney U-test (two-tail, P < .05) with proportions derived from WFBH operative volume quarterly reports. Results: Data revealed a relative decline from 2019 to 2020 in breast cancer screening. Screening mammograms decreased by 44% or 1558 fewer screening mammograms (Z = 4.75, P < .00001) and by 21% or 771 fewer for diagnostic mammograms (Z = 2.16, P = .03). With regards to breast cancer operations, we did not identify a statistically significant difference in number of new breast cancer operations at WFBH with 340 cases in 2020 as compared to 384 cases in 2019 (P = .9905). We compared a breast cancer severity score (weighted by stage at time of operation), which did not reveal statistically significant difference in clinical stage of breast cancer at time of operation (P = .71, U = 28).
CONCLUSION: Mammography was impacted more than breast surgery cases by the COVID-19 pandemic. More data needs to be collected to evaluate future morbidity and mortality related to breast cancer operations and persistent disparities related to delay in breast cancer care due to COVID-19.",,"FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",The American Surgeon,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Mass Screening; Pandemics,2022-04-13,2022,2022-04-13,2022-06,88,6,1051-1053,All OA; Green,Article,"Cairns, Ashley; Jones, V Morgan; Cronin, Kelly; Yocobozzi, Margaret; Howard, Clifford; Lesko, Nadja; Chiba, Akiko; Howard-McNatt, Marissa","Cairns, Ashley (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Jones, V Morgan (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Cronin, Kelly (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Yocobozzi, Margaret (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Howard, Clifford (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Lesko, Nadja (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Chiba, Akiko (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Howard-McNatt, Marissa (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.)",,"Cairns, Ashley (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Jones, V Morgan (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Cronin, Kelly (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Yocobozzi, Margaret (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Howard, Clifford (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Lesko, Nadja (Department of Radiology, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Chiba, Akiko (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.); Howard-McNatt, Marissa (Department of General Surgery, RinggoldID:12279Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.)",13,12,1.71,6.17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9014363,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147087383,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

The state of emergency was lifted on May 25, 2020. Although it was known that breast cancer screening was postponed or canceled during this period, the actual extent of postponement or cancellation has not been clarified.MethodsWe investigated postponement or cancellation of breast cancer screening between April and May 2020 using a cross-sectional, web-based, self-reported questionnaire survey. In addition, we examined the association between socioeconomic and health-related factors and postponement or cancellation by multivariable log-binominal regression.ResultsAmong 1874 women aged 30–79 years who had scheduled breast cancer screening during the study period, 493 women (26.3%) postponed or canceled screening. While women aged 30–39 years and 70–79 years postponed or canceled less frequently than women aged 40–49 years (prevalence ratio = 0.62 and 0.56, respectively), there was no significant difference between age groups in the women aged 40–69 years. Postponement or cancellation was more frequent in five prefectures, where the state of emergency was declared early (prevalence ratio = 1.25). Employment status, annual household income, family structure, academic background, smoking status, and fear of COVID-19 were not associated with postponement or cancellation.ConclusionAlthough care should be taken with the interpretation of these findings due to possible biases, they suggest that the postponement or cancellation of breast cancer screening might be due more to facility suspension than to individual factors. It is necessary to explore the ideal way of encouraging breast cancer screening uptake, in an environment of coexistence with COVID-19.","This study was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grants (grant number 18H03062 and 21H04856, Dr. Takahiro Tabuchi; 17H03589, Dr. Kota Katanoda; 19K10671, Dr. Keisuke Kuwahara; 19K19439, Dr. Kanami Tsuno; 19K10446, Dr. Kenji Takeuchi; 18H03107, Dr. Hiroshi Murayama), Research Support Program to Apply the Wisdom of the University to tackle COVID-19-Related Emergency Problems, University of Tsukuba (Dr. Ai Hori), Health Labour Sciences Research Grants (grant number 19FA1005, Dr. Isao Muraki; 19FA1012, Prof. Naoki Kondo), and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED; grant number 2033648, Prof. Takeo Fujiwara).

In 2020 there was no decrease in invasive tumours nor in in situ (513 vs. 493 and 76 vs. 73, respectively), while there was a significant decrease in surgery and increase in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.016). In the screening range (aged 45-74), no change in stage and grading was observed. In the four periods examined there was an increase in new diagnoses during pre-lockdown, a decrease in tumours especially at age 75+ [IRR 0.45; 95%CI 0.25-0.79] during lockdown, a recovery of new diagnoses in women 45+ in the low incidence period while in the last period there was a significant increase only for ages 45-74 [IRR 1.48; 95% CI 1.11-1.98]. Screening activities were suspended from March to May, but over the summer and autumn the backlog was addressed. This suggests that a prompt resumption of programmed screening may have limited the impact of the pandemic on the delay of breast cancer diagnoses.",,"This study was partially supported by Italian Ministry of Health–Ricerca Corrente Annual Program 2023 and by the “Soka Gakkai” Italian Buddhist Institute (Leading body: IFO – Istituto Regina Elena, Roma – Scientific responsible: Dr. Gennaro Ciliberto) through the project “Development of approaches and metrics to assess the impact and improve the outcome of patients with frail-ties in the COVID-19 era” (Project code: 2020-2016_RIC_2).",Cancers,,Farrukh Aqil,,2022-06-20,2022,2022-06-20,,14,12,3029,All OA;

OBJECTIVES: This study primarily aimed to evaluate in the setting of an organized breast cancer screening program the actual usage of an online appointment portal by the target population, i.e., how the online tool was used (type and timing of the actions performed) and by whom (users' characteristics); the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on its usage was also investigated. The effect of adopting this tool on the attendance to breast cancer screening was contextually investigated.
METHODS: Electronic data records of 75,903 women (45-74 years old, residing in the territory of Bologna Local Health Authority) were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: In total, 12.4% of women logged into the online portal at least once. Most of them (79.9%) rescheduled, 15.7% viewed, and 4.4% cancelled their own appointment. In addition, 40.6% of all rescheduling actions were performed by the online portal; the remaining was performed by the toll-free number/dedicated email address. The highest peak (13.8%) of web accesses was registered at 10 a.m. Monday to Friday, when the toll-free number service is available. Percentages of portal usage were higher: (1) among the younger women, of Italian nationality, and for the first time invited to mammographic screening (p < 0.0001), and (2) in the pandemic period versus the prepandemic period (12.5 vs. 8.6%, respectively; p < 0.001). Finally, when compared to not using, the online portal usage led to an overall reduction in the no-show rate of almost 20% (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The action mainly performed by using the online appointment portal was the appointment rescheduling. The usage of this tool had a positive effect on the no-show rate and it can be speculated that has led to a reduction of the request load to be handled by the center's screening staff. Finally, this study confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic boosted the use of digital technologies.",,Funding None.,Applied Clinical Informatics,,,Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Breast Neoplasms; Pandemics; Early Detection of Cancer; COVID-19,2023-08-09,2023,2023-08-09,2023-08,14,04,609-619,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Chiereghin, Angela; Pizzi, Lorenzo; Squillace, Lorena; Bazzani, Carmen; Roti, Lorenzo; Mezzetti, Francesca","Chiereghin, Angela (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Pizzi, Lorenzo (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Squillace, Lorena (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Bazzani, Carmen (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Roti, Lorenzo (Health Management, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Mezzetti, Francesca (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Pianura Est District, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.)","Chiereghin, Angela (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.)","Chiereghin, Angela (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Pizzi, Lorenzo (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Squillace, Lorena (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Bazzani, Carmen (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Roti, Lorenzo (Health Management, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.); Mezzetti, Francesca (Governance of Screening Programs Unit, Staff Department, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Pianura Est District, Local Health Authority of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.)",0,0,,,http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0043-1769910.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163148307,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

The aim of this study was to study the impact of COVID-19 on the stage of discovery of cancers diagnosed in the context of an organized breast cancer screening programme, as well as the impact on time to treatment. All women diagnosed with cancer in the Côte d'Or via organized breast cancer screening (first or second reading) from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 were included in this study. Using data from pathological laboratories, clinical centers, and the breast and gynecological cancer registry of the Côte d'Or, France, we collected socio-demographic, clinical and treatment data on all patients. We compared data from the year 2019 (before-Covid) with the year 2020 (Covid). We did not observe a significant difference in the stage of breast cancer at discovery, or in time to treatment. However, the number of invasive cancers and the clinical size of in situ cancers both increased in 2020. Although these results are reassuring, continued monitoring is needed to determine the downstream effects of the pandemic.","Acknowledgements

Routinely collected NHS England Cancer Waiting Time data were analysed to compare activity for breast cancer in the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. The number of referrals for suspected breast cancer was 28% lower (N = 231,765 versus N = 322,994), and the number of patients who received their first treatment for a breast cancer diagnosis was 16% lower (N = 19,965 versus N = 23,881). These data suggest that the number of breast cancers diagnosed during the first half of 2020 is not as low as initially feared, and a substantial proportion of the shortfall can be explained by the suspension of routine screening in March 2020.

Despite the attempt to utilize telemedicine to overcome barriers, visits remained lower than pre-pandemic levels. This raises concern for preventative medicine and chronic disease management. Methods This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic in primary care by utilizing two years of data from a family medicine clinic. Data obtained from the electronic medical record for March 2019 through February 2020 and March 2020 through February 2021 were used to evaluate monthly trends from the year before the pandemic and the first year of the pandemic in the following six categories: hypertension control, diabetes control, lipid profile screening, breast cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, and cervical cancer screening. Results The paired t-tests found a significant difference in the averages between the two years for all categories except hypertension control. The results for chi-square demonstrated a significant difference in four months for cervical cancer screening, five months for hypertension control and colorectal cancer screening, nine months for diabetes control and lipid profile screening, and 10 months for breast cancer screening. Conclusion These results show a profound impact of the pandemic on both preventative medicine and chronic disease management. This study had a large sample size but is not generalizable to the entire population. These results can help guide quality improvement measures going forward.

METHODS: We analyzed 6673 female patients aged 40 or older at increased inherited cancer risk in 2 large health care systems (NYU Langone Health [NYULH] and the University of Utah Health [UHealth]). Multinomial models were used to identify predictors of mammogram screening groups (non-adherent, pre-pandemic adherent, pandemic period adherent) in comparison to adherent females. Potential determinants included sociodemographic characteristics and neighborhood factors.
RESULTS: Comparing each cancer group in reference to the adherent group, a reduced likelihood of being non-adherent was associated with older age (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99), a greater number of relatives with cancer (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.86), and being seen at NYULH study site (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.60). More relatives with cancer were correlated with a lesser likelihood of being pandemic period adherent (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.97). A lower likelihood of being pre-pandemic adherent was seen in areas with less education (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.96) and NYULH study site (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.55). Finally, greater neighborhood deprivation (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.01) was associated with being non-adherent.
CONCLUSION: Breast screening during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with being older, having more relatives with cancer, residing in areas with less educational attainment, and being seen at NYULH; non-adherence was linked with greater neighborhood deprivation. These findings may mitigate risk of clinically important screening delays at times of disruptions in a population at greater risk for breast cancer.",,"Funding: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services study (3U01CA232826-03S2).",Cancer Control,,,Humans; Female; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Middle Aged; Early Detection of Cancer; Adult; United States; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Mammography; Aged; Patient Compliance; SARS-CoV-2; Risk Factors,2024-01,2024,2024-10-18,2024-01,31,,10732748241272727,All OA; Gold,Article,"Harris, Adrian; Bather, Jemar R.; Kawamoto, Kensaku; Del Fiol, Guilherme; Bradshaw, Richard L.; Kaiser-Jackson, Lauren; Monahan, Rachel; Kohlmann, Wendy; Liu, Feng; Ginsburg, Ophira; Goodman, Melody S.; Kaphingst, Kimberly A.","Harris, Adrian (Center for Anti-racism, Social Justice & Public Health, New York University School of Global Public Health, New York, NY, USA); Bather, Jemar R.

Using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER database, we estimated the age-adjusted mortality rates for female breast cancer between 2018 and 2023. We found that the age-adjusted death rate for breast cancer decreased gradually from 2018 to 2019 and 2020. This downward trend reversed in 2021, with an increase in breast cancer mortality, which then declined further in 2022 and 2023. These findings indicate that breast cancer mortality may have increased slightly in 2021, possibly as a result of limited access to screening and timely treatment during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, although the age-adjusted mortality rate continued to decline in the following two years.",,,Journal of Medical Screening,,,,2024-09-04,2024,2024-09-04,2024-09-04,,,9691413241278129,Closed,Article,"Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Lippi, Giuseppe","Mattiuzzi, Camilla (Medical Department, Rovereto Hospital, Provincial Agency for Social and Sanitary Services (APSS), Trento, Italy.); Lippi, Giuseppe (Section of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.)",,"Mattiuzzi, Camilla (Medical Department, Rovereto Hospital, Provincial Agency for Social and Sanitary Services (APSS), Trento, Italy.); Lippi, Giuseppe (University of Verona)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175387143,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The authors demonstrate how a cancer center in the largest city in Brazil has managed outpatient appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective study of patients who had their appointments through telemedicine at the AC Camargo Cancer Center between June 2020 and October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 77 patients who had telemedicine appointments, 36 (46.8%) accounted for breast cancer follow-up, 20 (26%) for breast cancer screening, 10 (13%) for benign breast disease evaluation, 7 (9%) for a second opinion, and 4 (5.2%) for general orientations. Routine surveillance/follow-up exams were requested for 45 (58.4%) patients and breast image exams and a request to return for a personal appointment for 30 (39%) patients. Two (2.6%) patients were requested to schedule a personal appointment immediately for a physical exam. In conclusion, telemedicine may be a feasible alternative to reduce personal outpatient appointments for cancer follow-up and breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank the A.C.

Breast cancer is distinct from other forms of cancer in which it is the primary cause of death for women. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly lower the risk of mortality, improving the prognosis for those who are affected. The death rate of breast cancer has been steadily rising, according to epidemiological data, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. This emphasizes the necessity of sensitive and precise technologies that can be utilized in early breast cancer diagnosis. In this process, biomarkers play a pivotal role by facilitating the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Currently, a wide variety of cancer biomarkers have been identified, improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis. These biomarkers can be applied in liquid biopsies as well as on solid tissues. In the context of breast cancer, biomarkers are particularly valuable for determining who is predisposed to the disease, predicting prognosis at the time of diagnosis, and selecting the best course of therapy. This review comprehensively explores the recently developed gene-based biomarkers from biofluids that are used in the context of breast cancer, as well as the conventional and cutting-edge techniques that have been employed for breast cancer diagnosis.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the pandemic on breast cancer screening, treatment, and reconstruction at a single institution in New York City.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine the number of mammograms, lumpectomies, mastectomies, and breast reconstruction operations performed between January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2021. Outcomes analyzed included changes in mammography, oncologic surgery, and breast reconstruction surgery volume before, during and after the start of the pandemic.
RESULTS: Mammography volume declined by 11% in March-May of 2020. Oncologic breast surgeries and reconstructive surgeries similarly declined by 6.8% and 11%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019, reaching their lowest levels in April 2020. The volume of all procedures increased during the summer of 2020. Mammography volumes in June and July 2020 were found to be at pre-COVID levels, and in October-December 2020 were 15% higher than in 2019. Oncologic breast surgeries saw a similar rebound in May 2020, with 24.6% more cases performed compared with May 2019. Breast reconstruction volumes increased, though changes in the types of reconstruction were noted. Oncoplastic closures were more common during the pandemic, while two-stage implant reconstruction and immediate autologous reconstruction decreased by 27% and 43%, respectively. All procedures are on track to increase in volume in 2021 compared to that in 2020.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the volume of breast cancer surveillance, surgical treatment, and reconstruction procedures. While it is reassuring that volumes have rebounded in 2021, efforts must be made to emphasize screening and treatment procedures in the face of subsequent surges, such as that recently attributable to the Delta and Omicron variants.",Ethical approval This study was conducted with approval from the institutional review board.

After correcting for trend and seasonality, the number of mammography examinations decreased by 68% in 2020q2, was around its usual level in 2020q3 and was reduced by 20-35% throughout 2020q4-2021q2. The reduction was caused by a combination of supply-side (temporary suspensions of screening) and demand-side (lower screening participation during the pandemic waves) factors. The number of new breast cancer diagnoses and mastectomy surgeries responded with a lag, and were below their usual level by 15-30% in all quarters between 2020q2 and 2021q2, apart from 2020q4, when there was no significant difference. Using a regression discontinuity framework, we found that the partial mastectomy rate (indicative of early diagnosis) dropped more substantially in 2020q2 in the 61-65 years old age group that was just below the age cut-off of organized screening than in the 66-70 years old age group, and this difference was partially offset in 2021q1.

This study sought to improve our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women being treated for breast cancer, both in general, and specifically related to their diagnosis.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between August 2021 and February 2022 with women who were receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer at the Stefanie Spielman Comprehensive Breast Center in Columbus, Ohio. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded using deductive dominant thematic analysis and inductive coding that allowed for categorization of data as well as identification of emergent themes.
RESULTS: Data collected from our 19 interviews revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic posed important challenges for breast cancer patients including fear of COVID-19 infection and feelings of isolation. Most interviewees noted they had been vaccinated against COVID-19 because of a desire to protect themselves and others from getting sick. Some women also expressed concerns about having delayed their screening mammograms due to the pandemic. Several patients described unexpected positive aspects of the pandemic such as being able to spend more time with family and having the ability to continue working because of the option to work from home during their cancer treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide important insight about the impact of COVID-19 on breast cancer patients. We highlight the positives that have been reported because of the pandemic, as well as the need to address delayed breast cancer screening.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Hannah Blumenfeld, Elizabeth Kress, Lauren Schnipke, Lindsey Sova, and Jaclyn Volney, all affiliated with the authors&#x27; organization, for their assistance with this project.

Due to fast transmission and high fatality rate drastic emergency restrictions were issued. During the lockdown, only urgent medical services are guaranteed. All non-urgent services, as breast cancer (BC) screening, are temporarily suspended. The potential of breast cancer screening programs in increasing the survival rate and decreasing the mortality rate has been widely confirmed. Suspension could lead to worse outcomes for breast cancer patients. Our study aimed to analyse the data and provide estimates regarding the temporary BC screening suspension.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data regarding breast cancer and respective screening programs were achieved through literature research and analysis.
RESULTS: Considering three different scenarios with respect to the lockdown's impact on breast cancer screening, we estimate that approximately 10,000 patients could have a missed diagnosis during these 3 months. Considering a 6-month period, as suggested by the Imperial college model, the number of patients who will not receive a diagnosis will rise to 16,000.
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer screening should be resumed as soon as possible in order to avoid further breast cancer missed diagnosis and reduce the impact of delayed diagnosis.",This study was found with the non-conditional contribution of the Italian Ministry of Health.,,In Vivo,,,"Aged; Betacoronavirus; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2",2020-08-31,2020,2020-08-31,2020,34,5,3047-3053,All OA; Gold,Article,"VANNI, GIANLUCA; PELLICCIARO, MARCO; MATERAZZO, MARCO; BRUNO, VALENTINA; OLDANI, CHIARA; PISTOLESE, CHIARA ADRIANA; BUONOMO, CHIARA; CASPI, JONATHAN; GUALTIERI, PAOLA; CHIARAVALLOTI, AGOSTINO; PALOMBI, LEONARDO; PICCIONE, EMILIO; BUONOMO, ORESTE CLAUDIO","VANNI, GIANLUCA (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); PELLICCIARO, MARCO (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); MATERAZZO, MARCO (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); BRUNO, VALENTINA (Section of Gynecology, Department of Surgical Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); OLDANI, CHIARA (Department of Economics and Engineering, University of Viterbo ‘La Tuscia’, Viterbo, Italy); PISTOLESE, CHIARA ADRIANA (Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Molecular Imaging and Radiotherapy Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); BUONOMO, CHIARA (Department of Emergency and Admission, Critical Care Medicine, Pain Medicine and Anesthetic Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); CASPI, JONATHAN (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); GUALTIERI, PAOLA (Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); CHIARAVALLOTI, AGOSTINO (Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy; IRCCS Neuromed, UOC Medicina Nucleare, Pozzilli, Italy); PALOMBI, LEONARDO (Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); PICCIONE, EMILIO (Section of Gynecology, Department of Surgical Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); BUONOMO, ORESTE CLAUDIO (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy)",,"VANNI, GIANLUCA (University of Rome Tor Vergata); PELLICCIARO, MARCO (University of Rome Tor Vergata); MATERAZZO, MARCO (University of Rome Tor Vergata); BRUNO, VALENTINA (University of Rome Tor Vergata); OLDANI, CHIARA (Department of Economics and Engineering, University of Viterbo ‘La Tuscia’, Viterbo, Italy); PISTOLESE, CHIARA ADRIANA (University of Rome Tor Vergata); BUONOMO, CHIARA (University of Rome Tor Vergata); CASPI, JONATHAN (University of Rome Tor Vergata); GUALTIERI, PAOLA (University of Rome Tor Vergata); CHIARAVALLOTI, AGOSTINO (University of Rome Tor Vergata; Istituto Neurologico Mediterraneo); PALOMBI, LEONARDO (University of Rome Tor Vergata); PICCIONE, EMILIO (University of Rome Tor Vergata); BUONOMO, ORESTE CLAUDIO (University of Rome Tor Vergata)",62,24,3.05,15.09,https://iv.iiarjournals.org/content/invivo/34/5/3047.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130472990,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective, cohort investigation of breast cancer patients at a multi-institution health system from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 with two time periods related to the pandemic: ""Early phase"" (March 18 - June 7) reflecting the time of the screening mammography moratorium and ""Late phase"" (June 8 - December 31) to reflect the time once screening mammography resumed. 2020 was compared to 2019 to exclude potential differences from temporal or seasonal changes. Variables included demographics, COVID related-deferral, cancer specific data, method of detection, type of treatment recommended and received.
Results: Fewer patients presented with a breast cancer diagnosis during Early phase 2020 when compared to any other time period. Numbers increased significantly in Late phase 2020; total numbers of patients seen in 2020 approached but did not completely reach that of 2019. When compared to other time periods, patients who presented during the moratorium on screening were younger, more likely to be black, had a higher Body Mass Index, and were more likely to have a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive tumor. There was a slight increase in size of presenting tumor and node positivity, although no differences in breast or axillary surgical management were identified.

It has also had a great impact on other public health issues, including cancer screening. Delayed cancer screening was also noticed in the U.S. during the pandemic, which may have led to both delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. In Taiwan, population-based cancer screening for breast cancer, oral cancer, colon cancer and cervical cancer has been executed and ongoing for years.MethodIn this study we have analyzed the change in screening numbers for cancer during the period of the 2019 to 2021 COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan.ResultsThrough our results we found that total cancer screening numbers decreased from 307,547 to 103,289 (a 66% decrease) from the years 2020 to 2021. Specifically, a 63%, 79%, 65% and 71% decrease in screening cases was seen for colon cancer, oral cancer, cervical cancer and breast cancer, respectively, during that period. A similar condition was noticed when comparing 2019 to 2021 when the disclosed total cancer screening numbers decreased by 70% (2019–2021); 65%, 83%, 70% and 76% in colon cancer, oral cancer, cervical cancer and breast cancer, respectively. Among these various cancer screenings, oral cancer screening showed the greatest reduction rate (a drop of 83% compared to 2019 and 79% compared to 2020). We also compared the reduction rates taken from different regions in Taiwan. It was in Taipei, where most COVID-19 cases were noted, that the greatest reduction rate of cancer screening numbers occurred (a drop of76% compared to 2019 and 74% compared to 2020). A proportional decrease of screening cases was also noticed in all areas when confirmed COVID-19 cases rose.ConclusionsScreening for cancers dropped significantly due to the pandemic and its effect on long-term health needs to be evaluated. Additionally, efforts should be taken to address these cancer screening number deficits which have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic.",The authors are grateful to the Biostatistics Task Force and Division of Community Medicine of Taichung Veterans General Hospital for their assistance with the statistical analysis in this study.,Not applicable.,BMC Health Services Research,,,Humans; Female; Early Detection of Cancer; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Pandemics; Taiwan; COVID-19; Mouth Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Colonic Neoplasms,2023-08-21,2023,2023-08-21,,23,1,878,All OA; Gold,Article,"Su, Chih-Hsuan; Hsu, Pi-Shan; Lin, Chu-Sheng","Su, Chih-Hsuan (Department of Family Medicine, Da-Chien Hospital, 36052, Miaoli, Taiwan; Department of Environment and Occupational Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 407219, Taichung, Taiwan); Hsu, Pi-Shan (Department of Family Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 407219, Taichung, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Microbiology and Public Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan); Lin, Chu-Sheng (Department of Family Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 407219, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Post-Baccalaureate Medicine, College of Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Center for Geriatrics & Gerontology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 407219, Taichung, Taiwan)","Lin, Chu-Sheng (Taichung Veterans General Hospital; National Chung Hsing University; Taichung Veterans General Hospital)","Su, Chih-Hsuan (Department of Family Medicine, Da-Chien Hospital, 36052, Miaoli, Taiwan; Taichung Veterans General Hospital); Hsu, Pi-Shan (Taichung Veterans General Hospital; National Chung Hsing University); Lin, Chu-Sheng (Taichung Veterans General Hospital; National Chung Hsing University; Taichung Veterans General Hospital)",0,0,,,https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12913-023-09901-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163404891,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study has been designed to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in breast cancer survivors and also estimate the risk of severe disease in this population.
Methods: Out of 6134 patients in the Shiraz Breast Cancer Registry (SBCR), A total of 292 patients who elapsed less than a year from their breast cancer diagnosis were excluded. We called 5842 patients. Finally, 4135 breast cancer survivors who agreed to cooperate were screened for COVID-19 symptoms by a symptom-based questionnaire in November 2020. COVID-19 in symptomatic participants was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The clinical and paraclinical data of the COVID-19 course were collected for patients with a positive PCR test.
Results: A total of 247 (5.9%) participants had at least reported one of the COVID-19 symptoms. Also, 17% of symptomatic participants had a positive PCR test; 83.7% had mild disease, 9.5% moderate, and 16.7% had severe conditions. Chronic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes were related to an increased risk of severe illness ( P = 0.018, P = 0.018, P = 0.002).

These underserved populations tend to have more advanced breast cancer presentations, in part due to delays in diagnosis resulting in later stage of disease presentation. To make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020 has resulted in significant healthcare disruptions leading to extensive delays in breast imaging services which are expected to negatively impact breast cancer mortality long-term. Given the worsening disparity in breast cancer mortality among racial/ethnic minorities and financially disadvantaged groups, it is vital to address these disparity gaps with the goal of reducing the barriers to timely breast cancer diagnosis and addressing breast cancer mortality differences among breast cancer patients. Therefore, this review aims to provide a discussion highlighting the disparities related to breast imaging access, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these disparities, current targeted interventions implemented in breast imaging practices to reduce these disparities, and future directions on the journey to reducing disparity gaps for breast imaging patients. Tackling the root cause factors of the persistent breast cancer-related disparities is critical to meeting the needs of patients who are disadvantaged and can lead to continued improvement in the quality of individualized care for patients who have higher breast cancer morbidity and mortality risks.",,Eniola Oluyemi reports receiving research funding (AUR GE Radiology Research Academic Fellowship Award).,Academic Radiology,,,Humans; Female; Healthcare Disparities; COVID-19; Health Services Accessibility; Pandemics; Breast Neoplasms,2022-03-25,2022,2022-03-25,2022-12,29,12,1852-1860,All OA; Green,Article,"Nguyen, Derek L; Ambinder, Emily B; Myers, Kelly S; Oluyemi, Eniola","Nguyen, Derek L (Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.); Ambinder, Emily B (Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.); Myers, Kelly S (Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.); Oluyemi, Eniola (Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in female individuals, with improved survival rates from early detection. An avoidance of screening, resulting in late detection, greatly affects survival and increases health care resource burden and costs.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate if a sustained decrease in public interest in screening occurred and to evaluate other search terms, and hence interest, associated with that.
METHODS: This study used Google Trends to analyze public interest in breast cancer screening and symptoms. We queried search data for 4 keyword terms (""mammogram,"" ""breast pain,"" ""breast lump,"" and ""nipple discharge"") from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2022. The relative search frequency metric was used to assess interest in these terms, and related queries were retrieved for each keyword to evaluate trends in search patterns.
RESULTS: Despite an initial drastic drop in interest in mammography from March to April 2020, this quickly recovered by July 2020. After this period, alongside the recovery of interest in screening, there was a rapid increase in interest for arranging for mammography. Relative search frequencies of perceived breast cancer-related symptoms such as breast lump, nipple discharge, and breast pain remained stable. There was increase public interest in natural and alternative therapy of breast lumps despite the recovery of interest in mammography and breast biopsy. There was a significant correlation between search activity and Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October.
CONCLUSIONS: Online search interest in breast cancer screening experienced a sharp decline at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a subsequent return to baseline interest in arranging for mammography followed this short period of decreased interest.",This study has received no financial support.,,JMIR Cancer,,Amaryllis Mavragani,,2023-06-06,2023,2023-06-06,,9,,e39105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tan, Si Ying; Tang, Matilda Swee Sun; Ong, Chin-Ann Johnny; Tan, Veronique Kiak Mien; Shannon, Nicholas Brian","Tan, Si Ying (Department of Breast Surgery, Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Breast Surgery, Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore); Tang, Matilda Swee Sun (Monash Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia); Ong, Chin-Ann Johnny (Department of Sarcoma Peritoneal and Rare Tumours, Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore); Tan, Veronique Kiak Mien (Department of Breast Surgery, Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Breast Surgery, Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore); Shannon, Nicholas Brian (Department of Sarcoma Peritoneal and Rare Tumours, Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore)","Tan, Si Ying (Singapore General Hospital; National Cancer Centre Singapore)","Tan, Si Ying (Singapore General Hospital; National Cancer Centre Singapore); Tang, Matilda Swee Sun (Monash Health); Ong, Chin-Ann Johnny (National Cancer Centre Singapore); Tan, Veronique Kiak Mien (Singapore General Hospital; National Cancer Centre Singapore); Shannon, Nicholas Brian (National Cancer Centre Singapore)",2,2,,,https://cancer.jmir.org/2023/1/e39105/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157927480,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

More and more, we are able to evaluate side effects of the pandemic in the healthcare sector. A negative impact on cancer diagnoses is one of them. Careful observation of trends in an academic gyneco-oncological context appears important to identify potential negative developments.MethodsWe analyzed the case number of gynecologic and breast cancer diagnoses in the period from January to June 2020 compared to 2019 and during the period of the first general German lockdown (March 22nd until May 5th 2020). Patients were characterized by age, tumor type, FIGO or TNM stage and presence of symptoms at initial hospital presentation.ResultsThe frequency of newly diagnosed gynecologic and breast cancer cases from beginning of January until end of June changed by − 10% and by − 12% during the lockdown in 2020 compared to 2019. In both periods, reduction of breast cancer cases was relatively larger than decrease of gynecologic cancers. Moreover, median patient age decreased. For the first half of 2020, we found a shift towards higher tumor stages (N+/M1 or FIGO III–IV). During the lockdown period, the appearance of tumor-associated symptoms at diagnosis increased by about 12%.ConclusionThis analysis illustrates the anticipated general decrease in diagnoses of primary cancers during the lockdown periods in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic for gynecologic and breast cancer cases.",We thank Malwina Biernat and Gertrud Gailer for support to prepare and complete the initial datasets.,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

A hospital‐based retrospective study,"BACKGROUND: The suspension of breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic altered patient diagnosis and management. This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns, screening delays and reduced healthcare attendance on changes in tumour and treatment characteristics, particularly for biologically more aggressive breast cancers.
METHODS: This retrospective single-hospital analysis utilized data from a prospective cancer database between July 2019 and June 2022. Patient, tumour and treatment factors were compared across pre-pandemic, pandemic and post-pandemic groups.
RESULTS: Symptomatic breast cancer increased from 42.3% in the pre-, 53.1% in the pandemic and 57% in the post- respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Compared to the pre-pandemic group (4.6%), an increase in stages 3 or 4 breast cancers in the pandemic (8.5%) and post-pandemic (7.1%) was found. Increased node-positivity in Ki67 > 20%, grade 3 or ER- tumours post-pandemic (+5.4%, +14.8%, +33.4%, respectively) was identified. More neoadjuvant chemotherapy was found in both the pandemic (+4.3%) and post-pandemic (+11.3%, P = 0.0261) groups. An increase in hypofractionated radiotherapy in the post-pandemic group (+9.4%) was also identified.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified a decrease in early-stage cancers and an increase in node positivity, particularly for biologically more aggressive tumours. An increase in the number of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hypofractionated radiotherapy during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods was also identified.","Acknowledgements The authors thank Daniela Von Hieber and Shari Emerton for assistance with ethics approval and Melissa Legg for assistance with data collection.

METHODS: An observational retrospective longitudinal study based on aggregated data from four European Union (EU) countries/regions investigating the time it took to receive breast cancer treatment. We compiled outputs from a federated analysis to detect structural breakpoints, confirming the empirical breakpoints by differences between the trends observed and forecasted after March 2020. Finally, we built several segmented regressions to explore the association of contextual factors with the observed changes in treatment delays.
RESULTS: We observed empirical structural breakpoints on the monthly median time to surgery trend in Aragon (ranging from 9.20 to 17.38 days), Marche (from 37.17 to 42.04 days) and Wales (from 28.67 to 35.08 days). On the contrary, no empirical structural breakpoints were observed in Belgium (ranging from 21.25 to 23.95 days) after the pandemic's beginning. Furthermore, we confirmed statistically significant differences between the observed trend and the forecasts for Aragon and Wales. Finally, we found the interaction between the region and the pandemic's start (before/after March 2020) significantly associated with the trend of delayed breast cancer treatment at the population level.
CONCLUSIONS: Although they were not clinically relevant, only Aragon and Wales showed significant differences with expected delays after March 2020. However, experiences differed between countries/regions, pointing to structural factors other than the pandemic.",,This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101018317.

METHODS: This is an audit study of performance screening and diagnostic indicators. Two periods were analysed: 2019, the pre-COVID period, and 2020, the COVID period. All women who underwent mammography in these periods were included. Indicators were compared between periods, and the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium benchmarks were used as a reference.
RESULTS: A comparison between the periods shows a reduction of 57.4% in screening and 4.4% in diagnosis using mammography. Cancer detection rate per 1000 screening mammograms dropped from 4.62 to 2.83 (p  =  0.031), while it increased from 84.43 to 89.36 in diagnosis mammograms (p  =  0.701), higher than the reference (34.4, p < 0.001). With regard to diagnosis, the proportion of minimal cancers was reduced (p  =  0.005) and was lower than the reference (40.0%, p < 0.001), along with the proportion of node-negative invasive cancers (p < 0.001). The mean size of invasive tumours was similar in the two periods (32.50 mm and 33.40 mm, p  =  0.808) but larger than the reference value (16.50 mm, p < 0.001). Recall rate was lower in the COVID period (22.55% vs. 27.37%, p  =  0.015).
CONCLUSION: The COVID pandemic caused an overall decrease in breast screening and detection of breast cancer cases, although the reduction in number of diagnosis mammograms performed was minimal. Tumour mean size was large in both periods, the pandemic highlighting a previous profile of detection at an advanced stage.",The authors would like to thank Helymar Machado for statistical analyses and the referral center staff for all care during the pre-COVID and pandemic periods.,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was performed during tenure of the research funding for the “Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP),” registered under the number 2017/21908-1.

Clinical parameters including symptoms, performance status, comorbidities and referral status were compared in patients, who were newly diagnosed with cancer in the period of the first lockdown from March 2020 to April 2020 and the second lockdown from November 2020 to December 2020 and compared to the same period in 2019.ResultsOur results showed a strong decline in newly diagnosed cancers during the lockdown periods: −45% in gynecological cancer and -52% in breast cancer compared to the same period in 2019. Compared to the analogue period of 2019, breast cancer patients reported significantly more tumor-associated symptoms (55% vs. 31%, p = 0.013) during and in between (48% vs. 32%, p = 0.022) the lockdowns. During the lockdown, periods in the group of breast cancer patients’ tumor stage varied significantly compared to 2019 (T2–T4; p = 0.047).ConclusionBoth lockdowns led to a strong decrease in newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers. Treatment delays in potentially curable disease could lead to inferior clinical outcomes, with the risk of missing the optimal treatment window.

METHODS: A telephone interview study was conducted at the end of April 2020. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was chosen to identify themes and concepts and a semi-structured interview guide was developed. The analysis was structured according to constructs from the theory of planned behaviour, including attitudes to breast cancer screening, norms and motivations to comply with breast cancer screening, perceived control and anticipated regret.
RESULTS: Interviews were carried out with 33 women aged 50-69 (mean 62) years. The women felt that screening was of secondary importance during the height of the pandemic and they felt low perceived control over transportation to the screening clinic and over the screening situation itself, where social distancing was impossible. They perceived messages from the authorities as conflicting regarding the request for social distancing and a lack of recommendations about using face masks at the screening clinic.
CONCLUSIONS: 
            Women who postponed or cancelled breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic felt that public recommendations appeared contradictory. Uncertainty about the 'new norm(al)' of COVID-19 made them stay at home, although the screening clinics remained open.

Patients themselves also constrained their visits to healthcare providers. In this study, we analysed the heterogeneous effects of the pandemic on the new diagnoses of lung, colorectal and breast cancer in Hungary.
DESIGN: Time series and panel models of quarterly administrative data, disaggregated by gender, age group and district of residence.
PARTICIPANTS: Data for the whole population of Hungary between the first quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2021.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of patients newly diagnosed with lung, colorectal and breast cancer, defined as those who were hospitalised with the appropriate primary International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision diagnosis code but had not had hospital encounters with such a code within the previous 5 years.
RESULTS: The incidence of lung, colorectal and breast cancer decreased by 14.4% (95% CI 10.8% to 17.8%), 19.9% (95% CI 12.2% to 26.9%) and 15.5% (95% CI 2.5% to 27.0%), respectively, during the examined period of the pandemic, with different time patterns across cancer types. The incidence decreased more among people at least 65 years old than among the younger (p<0.05 for lung cancer and p<0.1 for colorectal cancer). At the district level, both the previously negative income gap in lung cancer incidence and the previously positive income gap in breast cancer incidence significantly narrowed during the pandemic (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The decline in new cancer diagnoses, caused by a combination of supply-side and demand-side factors, suggests that some cancer cases have remained hidden. It calls for action by policy makers to engage individuals with high risk of cancer more in accessing healthcare services, to diagnose the disease early and to prepare for effective management of patient pathways from diagnosis to survival or end-of-life care.",The authors would like to thank the useful comments made by the members of the COVID-19 Working Group of the Hungarian Health Economics Association.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with breast cancer were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients who were operated in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic, and Group 2 consisted of patients who were operated within the first year of the pandemic. Tumor size, axillary lymph node positivity, distant organ metastasis status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and type of surgery performed were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The tumor size, axillary lymph node positivity, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p = .005, p = .012, p = .042, respectively). In addition, the number of breast-conserving surgery + sentinel lymph node biopsy were lower, while the number of mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p = .034).
CONCLUSION: Patients presented with larger breast tumors and increased axillary involvement during the pandemic.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in mammographic screening in Brazil, considering 2015 to 2021. This was descriptive ecologic study based on the retrospective data of Brazil's mammographic screening program. A Brazilian national screening database (DATASUS - SISCAN (Cancer System Information)) was used as the data source, and the data in this database are publicly available for download and analysis. We report the number of screening rate from January 2015 to December 2021, using 2020 as reference year for COVID-19. From 2015 to 2021, 10,763,894 mammograms were performed and included in the analysis. Reductions of 39.6% and 13.3% were found in 2020 in 2021, respectively. During the pandemic's peak, the reduction was more pronounced, with maximum reductions of 82.4% in May 2020 and 34.8% in April 2021. There was an increase in the number of mammograms performed on high-risk patients from 11.2% in 2020 to 13.9% in 2021.

A record-based descriptive study,"OBJECTIVES: To reveal the number of cancer screenings in primary care during the pandemic period and whether there is a change in screening compared to the pre-pandemic period.
METHODS: This record-based descriptive study was carried out by evaluating the number of people who applied to family health centers or cancer early diagnosis, screening, and education center (KETEM) units for cancer screening (breast, cervical, and colorectal) for any reason. The study data were scanned between January 2017 and December 2020 and were obtained from the Gaziantep Provincial Health Directorate Cancer Branch.
RESULTS: Breast cancer screening was the highest in December 2019 (n=2971), cervical cancer screening was the highest in October 2019 (n=4693), and colon cancer screening was the highest in September 2019 (n=2464). Breast cancer screening was the lowest in August 2020 (n=0), cervical cancer screening was the lowest in May 2020 (n=6), and colon cancer screening was the lowest in February and March 2018. Although the target populations and percentages in breast cancer, cervical cancer and colon cancer screenings increased with the following years, the screening populations and percentages decreased in 2020 compared to other years (percentages, 4.4%, 6.2%, 1.9%).

Methods: We conducted a before-and-after, study to evaluate participation, recall, false positives, the cancer detection rate, and cancer characteristics in our screening population from March 2020 to March 2021 compared with the four previous rounds (2012-2019). Using multilevel logistic regression models, we estimated the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of each of the performance indicators for the COVID-19 period, controlling by type of screening (prevalent or incident), socioeconomic index, family history of breast cancer, and menopausal status. We analyzed 144,779 invitations from 47,571women.
Results: During the COVID-19 period, the odds of participation were lower in first-time invitees (aOR = 0.90 [95% CI = 0.84-0.96]) and in those who had previously participated regularly and irregularly (aOR = 0.63 [95% CI = 0.59-0.67] and aOR = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.86-1.05], respectively). Participation showed a modest increase in women not attending any of the previous rounds (aOR = 1.10 [95% CI = 1.01-1.20]). The recall rate decreased in both prevalent and incident screening (aOR = 0.74 [95% CI = 0.56-0.99] and aOR = 0.80 [95% CI = 0.68-0.95], respectively). False positives also decreased in both groups (prevalent aOR = 0.92 [95% CI = 0.66-1.28] and incident aOR = 0.72 [95% CI = 0.59-0.88]). No significant differences were observed in compliance with recall (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.76-2.23), cancer detection rate (aOR = 0.91 [95% CI = 0.69-1.18]), or cancer stages.
Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected screening attendance, especially in previous participants and newcomers. We found a reduction in recall and false positives and no marked differences in cancer detection, indicating the robustness of the program. There is a need for further evaluations of interval cancers and potential diagnostic delays.

To date, participation in organized breast cancer screenings (OBCS) has been suboptimal worldwide. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors associated with deferral or non-performance of mammography during the COVID-19 pandemic for women who had previously participated in OBCS.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on a cohort of 6282 women from the Aube Department of France, who were invited to an OBCS in 2020. Participants were divided into women who promptly underwent screening after receiving an invitation (between 22 and 25 months elapsed since the last mammogram), women who underwent late screening (≥26 months since the last mammogram), and those who were never screened. Data were collected from a self-reported questionnaire. Comparative and multivariable analyses modeling the probability of each type of attendance were performed using these data.
RESULTS: In total, 2301 women (aged 50-74 years) returned a valid questionnaire. Compared to women who promptly underwent mammography, non- and late-screening participants were younger, had less frequent gynecological follow-up and a less frequent history of colorectal cancer screening. Women with higher education status and those residing in socially disadvantaged areas were more likely to attend late.
CONCLUSION: The absence of regular gynecological follow-up and the absence of colorectal cancer screening were significant factors associated with deferral of or non-attendance at OBCS.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the scientific commission of the CRCDC GE for the ethics approval and data provision; Johan Mérillot, for data extraction and preparation; the whole team from the CRCDC GE – Aube (Nathalie Boutry, Stéphanie Reinlé, Luisa De Azevedo Soares, Muriel Barry and Valérie Baudry) for handling the questionnaires and calls from the patients.

We used health administrative data to understand the changes in quality-of-care measures for primary care between October 2018 and April 2022. We examined the following domains: cancer screening, chronic disease (diabetes) management, high-risk prescribing, continuity of care and capacity of primary care services. Colorectal and breast cancer screenings declined after the pandemic and had not returned to baseline by study end. In patients living with diabetes, in-person visits and up-to-date retinopathy screening rates declined after the pandemic declaration and did not return to baseline by study end, while statin prescribing remained stable. High-risk opioid prescribing decreased over time and was not affected by the pandemic. Physician continuity remained stable, though new patient enrollments decreased over the pandemic but returned to baseline by study end. Existing disparities in colorectal cancer screening by income and recent registration widened during the pandemic. In summary, COVID-19 had a variable impact on primary care, with the strongest influence on preventive and chronic disease care that was dependent on in-person visits.",,"This study was supported by ICES, which is funded by an annual grant from the Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Long-Term Care.

We assessed rates and factors associated with cancer screenings among American Indian adults during the pandemic.
METHODS: From October 2020 through January 2021, we surveyed 767 American Indian adults residing in California and Oklahoma. We asked participants whether they had planned to obtain screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC) from March through December 2020 and whether screening was postponed because of COVID-19. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for factors associated with reasons for planned and postponed cancer screening.
RESULTS: Among 395 participants eligible for breast cancer screening, 234 (59.2%) planned to obtain the screening, 127 (54.3%) of whom postponed it. Among 517 participants eligible for cervical cancer screening, 357 (69.1%) planned to obtain the screening, 115 (32.2%) of whom postponed it. Among 454 participants eligible for CRC screening, 282 (62.1%) planned to obtain CRC screening, 80 of whom (28.4%) postponed it. In multivariate analyses, women who lived with a child (vs did not) had lower odds of planning to obtain a breast cancer screening (AOR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-1.0). Adherence to social distancing recommendations was associated with planning to have and postponement of cervical cancer screening (AOR = 7.3; 95% CI, 0.9-58.9). Participants who received (vs did not receive) social or financial support had higher odds of planning to have CRC screening (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9).
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic impeded completion of cancer screenings among American Indian adults. Interventions are needed to increase the intent to receive evidence-based cancer screenings among eligible American Indian adults.",,,Public Health Reports,,,,2024-06-04,2024,2024-06-04,2024-06-04,,,333549241254226,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Dang, Julie H T; Chen, Sixia; Hall, Spencer; Campbell, Janis E; Chen, Moon S; Doescher, Mark P","Dang, Julie H T (Department of Public Health Sciences, Division of Health Policy and Management, University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.); Chen, Sixia (Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Hudson College of Public Health, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.); Hall, Spencer (Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Hudson College of Public Health, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.); Campbell, Janis E (Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Hudson College of Public Health, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.); Chen, Moon S (Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.); Doescher, Mark P (Stephenson Cancer Center, College of Medicine, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Oklahoma College of Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.)",,"Dang, Julie H T (University of California, Davis); Chen, Sixia (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center); Hall, Spencer (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center); Campbell, Janis E (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center); Chen, Moon S (University of California, Davis); Doescher, Mark P (Stephenson Cancer Center)",0,0,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00333549241254226,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172457799,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Using data from Ontario, Canada, our objectives were to 1) quantify the overall pandemic impact on weekly bilateral screening mammography rates (per 100,000) of average-risk women aged 50-74 and 2) examine if COVID-19 has shifted any mammography inequalities according to age, immigration status, rurality, and access to material resources. Using a segmented negative binomial regression model, we estimated the mean change in rate at the start of the pandemic (the week of March 15, 2020) and changes in weekly trend of rates during the pandemic period (March 15-December 26, 2020) compared to the pre-pandemic period (January 3, 2016-March 14, 2020) for all women and for each subgroup. A 3-way interaction term (COVID-19*week*subgroup variable) was added to the model to detect any pandemic impact on screening disparities. Of the 3,481,283 mammograms, 8.6 % (n = 300,064) occurred during the pandemic period. Overall, the mean weekly rate dropped by 93.4 % (95 % CI 91.7 % - 94.8 %) at the beginning of COVID-19, followed by a weekly increase of 8.4 % (95 % CI 7.4 % - 9.4 %) until December 26, 2020. The pandemic did not shift any disparities (all interactions p > 0.05) and that women who were under 60 or over 70, immigrants, or with a limited access to material resources had persistently low screening rate in both periods. Interventions should proactively target these underserved populations with the goals of reducing advanced-stage breast cancer presentations and mortality.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In Brazil, the South and Southeast regions have the highest mortality rates. Understanding how they dealt with the diagnostic of a stigmatized disease amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential repercussions, may enable healthcare professionals to of life. Thus, this study is aimed at understanding the perception of women about the discovery of breast cancer and the impact of the disease on their lives.
METHODS: A qualitative study, with the participation of forty women with breast cancer, under chemotherapy treatment. It was performed in a hospital specialized in oncology, in Juiz de Fora, Brazil, in 2020 and 2021. Data collection was carried out with semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed with Bardin Content Analysis.
RESULTS: Based on the central theme ""Discovery of the disease"", these categories were developed: ""Discovery"" and ""Impact of the disease"". A large part of women noticed a change in the breast, even before routine checks. Upon the impact of cancer diagnosis, negative feelings arise, then going through a process of acceptance and coping. Some barriers were faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused delays in the diagnostic and impact caused by social isolation. Family, friends, and healthcare professionals integrated an important supporting network in order to help coping with the disease.
CONCLUSION: The consequences of a breast cancer diagnosis can be devastating. It is necessary that healthcare professionals know and embrace the feelings, beliefs, and values as a part of the aspects related to health. Valuing the supporting network of women suffering from the disease may favor the process of accepting and coping with the neoplasm. The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighted as an obstacle to be overcome specially when it comes to diagnostic assistance and availability of a support network. In that sense, it is worth mentioning the importance of a healthcare team able to offer full assistance, with quality.

This study aimed to estimate the short-term impact of the temporary shutdown (from March until May- June) of the cancer screening programs invitations in Flanders (Belgium) by looking at invitation coverage, percentage of people screened after invitation and the screening interval.MethodsYearly invitation coverage was calculated as the number of people who received an invitation, as a proportion of the people who should have received an invitation that year. Weekly response to the invitation was calculated as the number of people who were screened within 40 days of their date of invitation, as a percentage of the people who received an invitation that week (as a proxy for willingness to screen). Weekly screening interval was calculated as the mean number of months between the current screening and the previous screening of all the people who screened that week. The two last indicators were calculated for each week in 2019 and 2020, after which the difference between that week’s value in 2020 and 2019 with 95% confidence intervals. Results of these two indicators were also analysed after stratification for gender, age and participation history.ResultsInvitation coverage was not impacted in the colorectal and cervical cancer screening program. In the breast cancer screening program invitation coverage went down from 97.5% (2019) to 88.7% (2020), and the backlog of invitations was largely resolved in the first six months of 2021. The willingness to screen was minimally influenced by COVID-19. The breast cancer screening program had a temporary increase in screening interval in the first months following the restart after COVID-19 related shutdown, when it was on average 2.1 months longer than in 2019.ConclusionsWillingness to screen was minimally influenced by COVID-19, but there may be an influence on screening coverage because of lower invitation coverage, mainly for the for breast Cancer Screening Program. The increases in screening intervals for the three Cancer Screening Program seem reasonable and would probably not significantly increase the risk of delayed screening cancer diagnoses.

Initially, nonessential imaging studies, including screening mammography, were curtailed and even temporarily halted when lockdowns were instituted in many parts of the United States. As a result, imaging volumes plummeted while health care institutions worked to ensure safety measures were in place to protect patients and personnel. As COVID-19 infection levels started to stabilize in some areas, breast radiology practices sought guidance from national organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and radiology specialty societies, to develop strategies for patients to safely return for screening mammograms and other outpatient imaging studies. Postponement of breast cancer screening has led to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment that could negatively affect patient outcomes for years to come. In order to continue to provide necessary imaging services, breast radiologists will need to face and overcome ongoing practical challenges related to the pandemic, such as negative financial impacts on practices and patients, the need for modifications in delivery of imaging services and trainee education, and differences in the health care system as a whole, including the shift to telehealth for clinical care.

Alongside the stress associated with cancer itself, delays and complications due to COVID-19 may impact patients' mental health.
PURPOSE: To describe the experiences of Canadians living with breast cancer who received a diagnosis and/or treatment during the pandemic, and to identify their recommendations for improving patients well-being during future pandemics.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eighteen women living with breast cancer who also completed the Distress Thermometer questionnaire. The transcripts were analyzed using a descriptive thematic content methodology.
RESULTS: Women who started their breast cancer screening or treatment before the pandemic reported fewer delays and less psychological distress than those who started during the pandemic. Participants reported feeling dehumanized while receiving their medical care, being unable to be accompanied during medical visits, and fearing treatment interruption during the pandemic. Patient recommendations for improving care and psychological support included the presence of family caregivers at consultations to receive the diagnosis and for the first treatment session.
CONCLUSION: Study findings provide new insights on how healthcare restrictions during the pandemic impacted on patient experiences and their well-being during screening and treatment for breast cancer. The need for cancer nursing practices and care delivery strategies that promote the delivery of compassionate, patient-centred care and the provision of psychological support during future pandemics are identified.","The authors would like to thank the participants who agreed to share their experience and give time to the research study.

Although facilities have implemented a number of strategies to provide services, women's thoughts and experiences related to breast cancer screening and surveillance during a pandemic are not well known. This focus group study with women across seven states recruited through the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium aims to remedy this gap in information. Thirty women ranging in age from 31 to 69 participated in five virtual focus groups, eight of whom had prior breast cancer. The first three focus groups covered a range of topics related to screening and surveillance during the pandemic while the last two groups covered experiences and then a review of sample communications to women about screening and surveillance during the pandemic to obtain reactions and recommendations. More than half of the women had screening or surveillance during the pandemic. Coding and analyses resulted in nine themes in three topic areas: decision factors, screening experiences, and preferred communications. Themes included weighing the risks of COVID-19 versus cancer; feelings that screening and surveillance were mostly safe but barriers may be heightened; feeling safe when undergoing screening but receiving a range of pandemic-specific communications from none to a lot; and wanting communications that are personalized, clear and concise. Based on these findings, providers and facilities should assure women of pandemic safety measures, review methods and content of communications, and assess for barriers to screening that may be amplified during the pandemic, including anxiety and access.",The authors wish to thank all our research partners in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium who collaborated on participant recruitment and implementation of the focus groups.

We assess the potential factors affecting discontinuation of adjuvant early breast cancer treatment during the pandemic.
METHODS: Data were collected on all patients with early breast cancer undergoing adjuvant SACT, between 16 March and 17 April 2020 at a single UK cancer centre. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed on variables including age, recurrence risk, Index of Multiple Deprivation decile, presence of physical comorbidities, modality of treatment (neoadjuvant or adjuvant), type of treatment (cytotoxic chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies), percentage of cycles completed and availability of alternative treatments, with a binary dependent variable on treatment discontinuation.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients with early breast cancer were identified: 18 receiving neoadjuvant and 44 adjuvant therapies. Median age was 57.5 years (range 31-75 years). Age (P = 0.02), percentage of treatment cycles completed (P = 0.014) and presence of alternative treatment options (P = 0.019) were significant factors for SACT discontinuation during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: Factors affecting patients' decisions to discontinue SACT for early breast cancer during the Covid-19 pandemic were elucidated, which may help identify patients requiring additional support.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors have declared no conflict of interest.,,European Journal of Cancer Care,,,Humans; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Female; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Neoadjuvant Therapy,2022-08-11,2022,2022-08-11,2022-11,31,6,e13668,All OA; Green,Article,"Gatfield, Elinor R.; Bataineh, Adam; Kurdi, Bara El; Mukesh, Mukesh B.; Loo, Suat W.","Gatfield, Elinor R.

We aimed to determine how screening in the NBCCEDP recovered from these early declines as it is important for monitoring the long-term impact on women served by the program.
METHODS: Extending the previous analyses, we compared monthly breast (BC) and cervical cancer (CVC) screening volume in the NBCCEDP during 2020-2022, to five-year, pre-COVID-19 pandemic averages (2015-2019), and calculated percent change. Results were stratified by race/ethnicity and rurality groups. We employed multiple one-way ANOVA tests, which included multiple comparisons, to test for significant differences between groups.
RESULTS: By December 2022, NBCCEDP breast and cervical cancer screening volumes had not fully recovered to pre-COVID-19 5-year averages, and recovery in breast cancer screening volume was slower than that of cervical cancer. Both BC and CVC screening among women in metro areas showed the smallest average monthly deficits (-8.8% BC and -4.9% CVC) compared to monthly pre-COVID-19 pandemic 5-year averages, and screening among women in rural areas showed the greatest deficits (-37.3% BC and -26.7% CVC). BC and CVC screening among Hispanic women showed the greatest improvements compared to the pre-COVID-19 averages (8.2% BC and 9.5% CVC), and cervical cancer screening among non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander women showed the greatest deficits (-41.4% CVC).

Patients with cancer are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, adverse events, and high mortality, and should be the focus of epidemic prevention and treatment. However, real-world data on the safety of vaccines for patients with breast cancer are still scarce.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the safety of COVID-19 vaccines between patients vaccinated before or after being diagnosed with breast cancer.
METHODS: Patients with breast cancer who sought medical advice from October 2021 to December 2021 were screened. Those who received COVID-19 vaccines were enrolled in this study to analyze the safety of the vaccines. The primary outcome was patient-reported adverse events (AEs). All events after vaccine injection were retrospectively documented from the patients.
RESULTS: A total of 15,455 patients with breast cancer from 41 hospitals in 20 provinces in China were screened, and 5766 patients who received COVID-19 vaccines were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 45.1% (n=2599) of patients received vaccines before breast cancer diagnosis, 41.3% (n=2379) were vaccinated after diagnosis, and 13.6% (n=784) did not known the accurate date of vaccination or cancer diagnosis. Among the patients vaccinated after diagnosis, 85.4% (n=2032) were vaccinated 1 year after cancer diagnosis and 95.4% (n=2270) were vaccinated during early-stage cancer. Of all 5766 vaccinated patients, 93.9% (n=5415) received an inactivated vaccine, 3.7% (n=213) received a recombinant subunit vaccine, and 2.4% (n=138) received other vaccines, including adenovirus and mRNA vaccines. In the first injection of vaccines, 24.4% (n=10, 95% CI 11.2-37.5) of patients who received an adenovirus vaccine reported AEs, compared to only 12.5% (n=677, 95% CI 11.6-13.4) of those who received an inactivated vaccine. Patients with metastatic breast cancer reported the highest incidence of AEs (n=18, 16.5%, 95% CI 9.5-23.5). Following the second injection, patients who received an inactivated vaccine (n=464, 8.7%, 95% CI 8.0-9.5) and those who received a recombinant vaccine (n=25, 8.7%, 95% CI 5.5-12.0) reported the same incidence of AEs. No significant differences in patient-reported AEs were found between the healthy population and patients with breast cancer (16.4% vs 16.9%, respectively); the most common AEs were local pain (11.1% vs 9.1%, respectively), fatigue (5.5% vs 6.3%, respectively), and muscle soreness (2.3% vs 3.6%, respectively). The type of vaccine and time window of vaccination had little impact on patient-reported AEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients vaccinated before breast cancer diagnosis, there were no significant differences in patient-reported AEs in the patients vaccinated after diagnosis. Thus, it is safe for patients with breast cancer, especially for those in the early stage, to receive COVID-19 vaccines.

The aim of this study was to compare the COVID-19-related change in mammogram volumes and cancer detection at two affiliated academic breast centers, one that serves a predominantly African American patient population and one that serves a predominantly non-African American patient population.
Materials and methods: For the purpose of anonymity, racial demographics were collected and the center with a higher African American patient population was designated as institution A, while the center with a higher non-African American patient population was designated as institution B. Careful selection of the two breast centers was instituted in order to limit the impact of potential confounders other than race.An Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption was obtained and two Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) reports were generated; one for March 2020 through September 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and one for March 2019 through September 2019 to serve as the pre-pandemic control group. The i2b2 Query Analysis Tool® was used to obtain racial demographic data and compare the percent change in screening and diagnostic mammograms, image-guided biopsies, total cancers diagnosed by imaging, and percent of minimal cancers for both institutions.
Results: Screening mammograms and breast cancer detection decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 at both institutions. However, the percent change from 2019 to 2020 was greater at institution A than at institution B. Percent minimal cancers, an indicator of early-stage breast cancer also decreased more drastically at institution A than at institution B. Interestingly, the total number of diagnostic exams and image-guided biopsies increased in 2020 at institution B, whereas both decreased at institution A.
Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to worsening racial disparities in breast cancer screening. In an effort to narrow future disparity, it is crucial for radiologists and other health care providers to be aware of this inequality and educate all women on the importance of obtaining routine screening mammography.

Demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, race, ethnicity, breast density, breast cancer history, insurance status, imaging facility type used, and need for interpreter, were compared between patients imaged from March 16 to October 31 in 2019 (baseline cohort) and 2020 (COVID-19-impacted cohort). Census data and an online map service were used to impute socioeconomic variables and calculate travel times for each patient. Logistic regression was used to identify patient characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures.ResultsThe year-over-year cumulative difference in screening mammogram volumes peaked in week 21, with 2962 fewer exams in the COVID-19-impacted year. By week 47, this deficit had reduced by 49.4% to 1498. A lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures was independently associated with younger age (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, p < 0.001), residence in a higher poverty area (OR 0.991, p = 0.014), lack of health insurance (OR 0.65, p = 0.007), need for an interpreter (OR 0.68, p = 0.029), longer travel time (OR 0.998, p < 0.001), and utilization of mobile mammography services (OR 0.27, p < 0.001).ConclusionSeveral patient factors are associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening mammography after COVID-19-related closures. Knowledge of these factors can guide targeted outreach to vulnerable patients to facilitate breast cancer screening.","The authors would like to acknowledge Rajesh Desai, MA, research specialist and lead programmer for the Population Health and Cancer Outcomes Core, UVA Cancer Center, for his assistance with geocoding addresses, linking U.S. Census data to obtain socioeconomic information, and calculating patient travel times.",FundingNot applicable.

For aim one, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to compare the treatment of women diagnosed within four periods of 2020: pre-COVID (weeks 1–8), transition (weeks 9–12), lockdown (weeks 13–17), and care restart (weeks 18–26), with data from 2018/2019 as reference. Wilcoxon rank-sums test was used to compare treatment intervals, using a two-sided p-value < 0.05. For aim two, number of treatments started per week in 2020 was compared with 2018/2019.ResultsWe selected 34,097 women for aim one. Compared to 2018/2019, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was less likely for stage I (OR 0.24, 95%CI 0.11–0.53), stage II (OR 0.63, 95%CI 0.47–0.86), and hormone receptor+/HER2− tumors (OR 0.55, 95%CI 0.41–0.75) diagnosed during transition. Time between diagnosis and first treatment decreased for patients diagnosed during lockdown with a stage I (p < 0.01), II (p < 0.01) or III tumor (p = 0.01). We selected 30,002 women for aim two. The number of neo-adjuvant endocrine therapies and surgeries starting in week 14, 2020, increased by 339% and 18%, respectively. The number of adjuvant chemotherapies decreased by 42% in week 15 and increased by 44% in week 22.ConclusionThe pandemic and subsequently altered treatment recommendations affected multiple aspects of the breast cancer treatment strategy and the number of treatments started per week.","This work was supported by The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw), project number: 10430022010014.

Materials and methods: Patients were triaged and separated into three different clinical scenarios by performing a telephone questionnaire before each diagnostic exam or a nasopharyngeal swab before every recovery. Specific procedures for each scenario are described. Results: From July to October 2020, 994 exams were performed. A total of 16 cancers and 7 suspected COVID-19 patients were identified. No medical staff were infected. Conclusion: This protocol is an example of the practical use of guidelines applied to a breast unit to assist specialists in preventing COVID-19 infection and optimizing resources for breast cancer diagnosis.","D Tari: study planning, data curation, investigation, writing original draft, review and editing.

Using high-quality population-based cancer registry data, representing 83% of the US population, this study examined breast cancer incidence rates by estrogen receptor (ER) status in women aged 20-84 years from 2004 to 2020. The incidence rate of ER-positive cancer increased by 1.75% per year from 2004 to 2009 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26%-3.15%) and has slowed to a 0.87% annual increase (95% CI = 0.41%-1.03%) from 2009 to 2019, followed by a 10.2% reduction from 2019 to 2020. Trends were generally similar across race and ethnicity, although young women (20-49 years), Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic women experienced steady increases until 2019. The incidence rate of ER-negative cancer decreased by 3.13% annually (95% CI = -4.2% to -2.55%) from 2004 to 2012, and the decrease stabilized from 2012 to 2019 (annual percent change: 0.55%; 95% CI = -1.30% to 0.92%), followed by a 6.0% reduction from 2019 to 2020, with trends generally consistent by age and across racial and ethnic groups. The stabilization of the steep decline in ER-negative cancer suggests a departure from the encouraging trajectories projected in earlier studies. Coupled with the deceleration in the rise of ER-positive cancer, the latest trend signals a potential stabilization in the previous rise of the proportional burden of ER-positive cancer. Understanding the impact of the pandemic on each subtype of breast cancer individually may provide a more comprehensive insight into its long-term sequelae on survival and mortality.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Intramural Research Department of the American Cancer Society.

We aim to summarize the challenges faced by LMICs in providing breast cancer care during the pandemic and their response during this crisis.Recent FindingsConversion of oncology centers into COVID-19 isolation centers and lack of LMIC applicable guidelines for breast cancer treatment worsened the challenge for providers. Few LMICs changed their management framework, taking steps like triaging patients, prioritizing care, therapeutic spacing, and a shift to telehealth.SummaryModified protocols where available have served LMICs well for resource allocation; however, effectiveness of these cannot be determined due to lack of outcomes reporting. This pandemic has underscored the importance of flexibility, prompt intervention, good communication, and reassessment to address unexpected healthcare challenges and has been a learning lesson to help tailor guidelines early in the future.",,,Current Breast Cancer Reports,,,,2021-04-16,2021,2021-04-16,2021-06,13,2,63-68,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Shahzad, Hania; Mubarik, Fatima; Sattar, Abida K.","Shahzad, Hania (Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Mubarik, Fatima (Medical College, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan); Sattar, Abida K.

Evidence from the Mexican Institute of Social Security,"AIM: To evaluate the progress of the Mexican Institute of Social Security Recovery Policy (IMSS-RP) in addressing the decline in essential health services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We analyzed eleven indicators of essential health services from 35 IMSS state delegations. The assessment included ambulatory and hospital care indicators such as breast and cervical cancer screening, family medicine, dental and specialty visits, diabetes and hypertension visits and health outcomes, deliveries, and elective surgeries. We analyzed the period before (January 2018-March 2021) and during (April 2021-June 2023) the implementation of the IMSS-RP. Statistical analysis to determine the association of the policy with service indicators and the change in their trends included an interrupted time series analysis and Poisson Generalized Estimating Equation models.
RESULTS: The volume of services showed substantial declines during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching between 11 and 81% of pre-pandemic levels. All services increased significantly during the first 27 months of the IMSS-RP implementation; specialty visits, cervical and breast cancer screening, and diabetes control exceeded pre-pandemic levels (103%,112%,103%, and 138%, respectively). However, only deliveries and the percentage of patients with controlled diabetes and hypertension showed a stable increase following the IMSS-RP implementation, whereas the remaining services showed an initial increase but began to decrease over time.
CONCLUSIONS: After 27 months of implementation, IMSS-RP achieved progress in increasing the volume of essential health services and improving chronic disease control. However, declining trends in several services signal the need to focalize the policy.","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Dr. Luis Rafael Pérez Enriquez, head of the IMSS Epidemiological Surveillance Connection Area for his assistance in providing access to the data.

SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population- and registry-based study during 2020. The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases.
RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0% (95% confidence interval - 22.0% to 1.5%), resulting in a 24% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019.
CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to compensate for the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on breast cancer diagnosis relatively promptly, and it is of crucial importance to do it as soon as possible. Moreover, as shown by this study's results on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases during the second wave of the pandemic, these adverse effects are preventable to a non-negligible extent.",,,The Oncologist,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Croatia; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Registries; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2,2021-04-28,2021,2021-04-28,2021-07-01,26,7,e1156-e1160,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Vrdoljak, Eduard; Balja, Melita Perić; Marušić, Zlatko; Avirović, Manuela; Blažičević, Valerija; Tomasović, Čedna; Čerina, Dora; Bajić, Žarko; Miše, Branka Petrić; Lovasić, Ingrid Belac; Flam, Josipa; Tomić, Snježana","Vrdoljak, Eduard (Department of Oncology, Clinical Hospital Centre Split, School of Medicine, University of Split, Split, Croatia); Balja, Melita Perić (Department of Pathology, Clinical Hospital Centre Sisters of Mercy, Zagreb, Croatia); Marušić, Zlatko (Department of Pathology, Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia); Avirović, Manuela (Department of Pathology, Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia); Blažičević, Valerija (Department of Pathology, Clinical Hospital Centre Osijek, Osijek, Croatia); Tomasović, Čedna (Department of Pathology, Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb, Croatia); Čerina, Dora (Department of Oncology, Clinical Hospital Centre Split, School of Medicine, University of Split, Split, Croatia); Bajić, Žarko (Research unit “Dr. Mirko Grmek,” University Psychiatric Hospital “Sveti Ivan,” Zagreb, Croatia); Miše, Branka Petrić (Department of Oncology, Clinical Hospital Centre Split, School of Medicine, University of Split, Split, Croatia); Lovasić, Ingrid Belac (Department of Oncology, Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia); Flam, Josipa (Department of Oncology, Clinical Hospital Centre Osijek, Osijek, Croatia); Tomić, Snježana (Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Split, Split, Croatia)","Vrdoljak, Eduard (University of Split)","Vrdoljak, Eduard (University of Split); Balja, Melita Perić (University Hospital Centre Zagreb); Marušić, Zlatko (University Hospital Centre Zagreb); Avirović, Manuela (Klinički Bolnički Centar Rijeka); Blažičević, Valerija (Department of Pathology, Clinical Hospital Centre Osijek, Osijek, Croatia); Tomasović, Čedna (University Hospital Dubrava); Čerina, Dora (University of Split); Bajić, Žarko (Psychiatric Hospital Sveti Ivan); Miše, Branka Petrić (University of Split); Lovasić, Ingrid Belac (Klinički Bolnički Centar Rijeka); Flam, Josipa (Department of Oncology, Clinical Hospital Centre Osijek, Osijek, Croatia); Tomić, Snježana (Klinički Bolnički Centar Split)",21,12,1.96,6.42,https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article-pdf/26/7/e1156/42367461/oncolo_26_7_e1156.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137220851,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this study, we evaluated the impact of the state of emergency period during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mar. 17 to June 15, 2020) on cancer diagnoses, stage at diagnosis and 1-year survival in Alberta.
METHODS: We included new diagnoses of the 10 most prevalent cancer types from Jan. 1, 2018, to Dec. 31, 2020. We followed patients up to Dec. 31, 2021. We used interrupted time series analysis to examine the impact of the first COVID-19-related state of emergency in Alberta on the number of cancer diagnoses. We used multivariable Cox regression to compare 1-year survival of the patients who received a diagnosis during 2020 after the state of emergency with those who received a diagnosis during 2018 and 2019. We also performed stage-specific analyses.
RESULTS: We observed significant reductions in diagnoses of breast cancer (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.76), prostate cancer (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.56-0.73) and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.56- 0.74) and melanoma (IRR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47-0.69) during the state of emergency period compared with the period before it. These decreases largely occurred among early-stage rather than late-stage diagnoses. Patients who received a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and uterine cancer in 2020 had lower 1-year survival than those diagnosed in 2018; no other cancer sites had lower survival.
INTERPRETATION: The results from our analyses suggest that health care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta considerably affected cancer outcomes. Given that the largest impact was observed among early-stage cancers and those with organized screening programs, additional system capacity may be needed to mitigate future impact.",Funding: The study was supported by the Armstrong Investigatorship in Molecular Cancer Epidemiology at the Cumming School of Medicine.

METHODS: We gathered information from primary reimbursement data sets of the public health system of São Paulo, Brazil, from April 2020 to November 2021, and compared these data with those of the pre-COVID-19 period. We used an interrupted time series model to estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of key procedures of breast and cervical cancer health care chain.
RESULTS: We estimated that 1,149,727, 2,693, and 713,616 pap smears, conizations, and mammograms, respectively, were missed or delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with those in the years immediately before the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions. Specifically, we observed an acute decrease of procedures after the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, with a trend to recovery in the long term. Regarding the systemic treatment analysis, we observed a 25% reduction in the rate of initiation of adjuvant systemic treatment for early breast cancer (stage I/II). However, we did not find a clear effect on the other settings of systemic treatment for breast cancer. We estimated an excess of 156 patients starting palliative care for cervical cancer after the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the performance rate of pap smears, conizations, and mammograms. The initiation of adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer was most susceptible to COVID-19's health system disruption. Furthermore, the downward trend of treatment of advanced cervical cancer was interrupted. Therefore, public health policies are urgently needed to decrease the incidence of advanced cervical and breast cancers caused by delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation.The COVID-19 control policies resulted in reduction of cancer patients' delivery of care. This study evaluated the pandemic's influence in key procedures of breast and cervical cancer chain of care in São Paulo, Brazil. We observed a substantial reduction in the number of mammograms, pap smears, and conizations performed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, stage I and II breast cancer adjuvant treatment presented a reduced realization rate, whereas palliative treatment delivered for advanced cervical cancer increased. Our results support the need for public health policies focused on mitigating the long-term effects of COVID-19 in cancer-related mortality.",,,JCO Global Oncology,,,Brazil; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Pandemics; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,2022-06-13,2022,2022-06-13,2022-06,8,8,e2100371,All OA; Gold,Article,"Duarte, Mateus B.O.; Argenton, Juliana L.P.; Carvalheira, José B.C.","Duarte, Mateus B.O.

METHODS: The monthly volume of breast biopsies and breast cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic (during January 21 and July 31, 2020) was compared to the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19).
RESULTS: Taiwan recorded a lower COVID-19 incidence rate (20.2 cases per million population) than other Asian countries. The screen-detected lesions accounted for 55% and 36% of 2019 and 2020 total biopsied lesions, respectively. Total breast biopsy, mammography-guided, and ultrasound-guided biopsies decreased by 17%, 23%, and 14%, respectively, from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19. Monthly differences were significant in total biopsy (p=0.03), mammography-guided biopsy (p=0.04), and a benign pathology result after breast biopsy (p<0.01). Nearly 46% decline was noted in the biopsy results of non-invasive breast cancer in 2020. The number of total breast cancers and early breast cancers (stages 0 and 1) decreased by 10% and 38%, respectively, during pandemic. Individuals with early breast cancer accounted for 71% and 49% of the total diagnosed breast cancer in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The pandemic significantly delayed early breast cancer detection in Taiwan despite low COVID-19 incidence.

In order to examine changes in the surgical and oncological management of BC patients during different phases of COVID-19 pandemic, we took advantage of a selection quality indicators (QIs). We performed the analyses in two time-frames, from July to September (Jul-Sep) (2019 versus 2020) and from October to December (Oct-Dec) (2019 versus 2020).ResultsOur analysis did not show any statistically significant difference in terms of diagnosis, surgical, oncological and radiation therapy procedures between the two trimesters 2019 and 2020. Nevertheless, we observed statistically significant differences, favoring 2020, when analyzing time-to surgery and time-to radiotherapy. On the other hand, we observed a significant reduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and we did not recollect any data on a major use of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.ConclusionsIn Italian Breast Centers, partners of Senonetwork, we could not observe any treatment delay or change in standard clinical practice for BC care during the 2020 pandemic year, compared to 2019 pre-pandemic year. This finding is in contrast with the globally reported decrease in the performance of the Italian Breast Centers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has to be linked to the sharp selection of Senonetwork Breast Centers.","Francesca Pellini (Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy), Simona Grossi (Breast Centre Ortona - ASL2 Abruzzo, Italy), Marina Bortul (Breast Unit Trieste, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Giuliano Isontina, Trieste, Italy), Alfredo Tafà AUSL di Bologna (IRCCS Scienze Neurologiche, Ospedale Bellaria, Italy), Giovanni Tazzioli (Breast Unit Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico di Modena, Italy), Matteo Ghilli (Centro Senologico Multidisciplinare, AOUP, Pisa, Italy), Tiziana Mastropietro (Centro di Senologia, Azienda Ospedaliera San Giovanni Addolorata, Rome, Italy), Francesco Caruso (Breast Centre Humanitas Catania, Misterbianco, Catania, Italy), Andrea Bonetti (Breast Centre Azienda ULSS9 Scaligera, Ospedale Mater Sautis Legnago, Verona, Italy), Angelica Della Valle (Breast Surgery Department, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy), Alessandra Huscher (Fondazione Poliambulanza, Brescia, Italy), Corrado Tinterri (Breast Unit, Humanitas Research Hospital, IRCCS, Rozzano, Milan, Italy), Armando Santoro (UO of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Humanitas Research Hospital, IRCCS, Rozzano, Milan, Italy; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy), Marco Klinger (Reconstructive and Aesthetic Plastic Surgery School, Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine BIOMETRA - Plastic Surgery Unit, University of Milan, Humanitas Research Hospital, IRCCS, Rozzano, Milan, Italy), Mario Taffurelli (IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Policlinico di S.

We sought to understand the sequalae of these recommendations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of lung, colorectal, and breast cancer. Data was collected from our institutional cancer registry. Prepandemic (2016-2019) was compared with pandemic (2020) data.
RESULTS: Three thousand three sixty one screening chest computed tomography scans (CTs), 35,917 colonoscopies, and 48,093 screening mammograms were performed. There was no difference in CTs [81.0 (SEM10.0) vs. 65.6 (SEM3.29), P =0.067] or mammograms [1017.0 (SEM171.8) vs. 809.4 (SEM56.41), P =0.177] in 2020 versus prepandemic. There were fewer colonoscopies in 2020 [651.4 (SEM103.5) vs. 758.91 (SEM11.79), P =0.043]. There was a decrease in cancer diagnoses per month in 2020 of lung [22.70 (SEM1.469) vs. 28.75 (SEM0.8216), P =0.003] and breast [38.56 (SEM6.133) vs. 51.82 (SEM1.257), P =0.001], but not colorectal [13.11 (SEM1.467) vs. 15.88 (SEM0.585), P =0.074] cancer. There was no change in stage at presentation for lung ( P =0.717), breast ( P =0.115), or colorectal cancer ( P =0.180). Lung had a shorter time-to-treatment in 2020 [38.92 days (SEM 2.48) vs. 66 (SEM1.46), P =0.002].
CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, there was no difference in screening studies for lung and breast cancer but there was a decrease in new diagnoses. Although there were fewer colonoscopies performed in 2020, there was no change in new colorectal cancer diagnoses. Despite changes in guidelines during the pandemic, the time-to-treatment for lung cancer was shorter and was unchanged for colorectal and breast cancer. These findings highlight the importance of continuing care for a vulnerable patient population despite a pandemic.","The authors acknowledge Maureen Romero and George Rockett for their assistance, without which this study would not be possible.",,American Journal of Clinical Oncology,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies,2022-08-19,2022,2022-08-19,2022-09,45,9,381-390,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Lou, Johanna; Kooragayala, Keshav; Williams, Jennifer P.; Sandilos, Georgianna; Butchy, Margaret V.; Yoon-Flannery, Kahyun; Kwiatt, Michael; Hong, Young Ki; Shersher, David D.; Burg, Jennifer M.","Lou, Johanna (Cooper University Hospital/Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Department of Surgery, Camden, NJ); Kooragayala, Keshav (Cooper University Hospital/Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Department of Surgery, Camden, NJ); Williams, Jennifer P.

We aimed to investigate the effect of the pandemic-induced suspension on the screening interval, and its subsequent association with the tumor characteristics and treatment of screen-detected (SDC) and interval breast cancer (IC).
METHODS: Information about women aged 50-69, participating in BreastScreen Norway, and diagnosed with a SDC (N = 3799) or IC (N = 1806) between 2018 and 2021 was extracted from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between COVID-19 induced prolonged screening intervals and tumor characteristics and treatment.
RESULTS: Women with a SDC and their last screening exam before the pandemic had a median screening interval of 24.0 months (interquartile range: 23.8-24.5), compared to 27.0 months (interquartile range: 25.8-28.5) for those with their last screening during the pandemic. The tumor characteristics and treatment of women with a SDC, last screening during the pandemic, and a screening interval of 29-31 months, did not differ from those of women with a SDC, last screening before the pandemic, and a screening interval of 23-25 months. ICs detected 24-31 months after screening, were more likely to be histological grade 3 compared to ICs detected 0-23 months after screening (odds ratio: 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-induced prolonged screening intervals were not associated with the tumor characteristics and treatment of SDCs, but did increase the risk of a histopathological grade 3 IC. This study provides insights into the possible effects of extending the screening interval.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Solveig Hofvind is the head of BreastScreen Norway.

This survey evaluated patient perspectives on follow-up care.MethodsPatients with EBC undergoing surveillance were surveyed about follow-up protocols, perceptions, and interest in clinical trials assessing different follow-up strategies.ResultsOf 402 approached patients 270 completed the survey (response rate 67%). Median age 62.5 years (range 25–86) and median time since breast cancer diagnosis was 3.8 years (range < 1–33 years). Most (n = 148/244, 60%) were followed by more than one provider. Routine follow-ups with breast examination were mostly conducted by medical/radiation oncologists every 6 months (n = 110/236, 46%) or annually (n = 106/236, 44%). Participants felt routine follow-up was useful to monitor for recurrence, manage side effects of cancer treatment and to provide support/reassurance. Most participants felt regular follow-up care would detect recurrent cancer earlier (n = 214/255, 96%) and increase survival (n = 218/249, 88%). The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of in-person visits for 54% of patients (n = 63/117).

Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are rising, and more women are seeking mastectomy as treatment and as prophylaxis.
METHODS: Postmastectomy breast reconstruction often begins at the time of mastectomy in coordination with the oncologic breast surgeons. Immediate breast reconstruction increases complication rate (11% vs 4%) and unplanned reoperation rate (7% vs 4%), requiring more personnel and resources used during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of patient care.
DISCUSSION: In the setting of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), breast reconstruction demands a unique and nuanced approach, as most forms of breast reconstruction can occur successfully in a delayed fashion. While this may prolong the overall time until completion of reconstruction, other factors come into play in the setting of a communicable (potentially deadly) illness. Factors that must be considered include allocation of essential resources and protection of patients and families from disease transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Plastic surgeons performing breast reconstruction must take these factors into account when counseling their patients, colleagues, and institutions and be proactive in determining which procedures are time-critical and which should be postponed until the disaster situation has relieved.",,,Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery Global Open,,,,2020-06-09,2020,2020-06-09,,8,6,e2967,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chetta, Matthew D.; Schoenbrunner, Anna R.; Lee, Clara N.","Chetta, Matthew D.

Guidelines initially halted elective procedures, subsequently encouraging less invasive surgeries and restricting breast reconstruction options. We examined the effects of COVID-19 on oncologic breast surgery and reconstruction rates during the first year of the pandemic.
METHODS: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, we performed an observational examination of female surgical breast cancer patients from 2017 to 2020. We analyzed annual rates of lumpectomy, mastectomy (unilateral/contralateral prophylactic/bilateral prophylactic), and breast reconstruction (alloplastic/autologous) and compared 2019 and 2020 reconstruction cohorts to evaluate the effect of COVID-19.
RESULTS: From 2017 to 2020, 175 949 patients underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without reconstruction. From 2019 to 2020, patient volume declined by 10.7%, unilateral mastectomy rates increased (70.5% to 71.9%, p = 0.003), and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy rates decreased. While overall reconstruction rates were unchanged, tissue expander reconstruction increased (64.0% to 68.4%, p < 0.001) and direct-to-implant and autologous reconstruction decreased. Outpatient alloplastic reconstruction increased (65.7% to 73.8%, p < 0.0001), and length of hospital stay decreased for all reconstruction patients (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, there was a nearly 11% decline in breast cancer surgeries, comparable mastectomy and reconstruction rates, increased use of outpatient alloplastic reconstruction, and significantly reduced in-hospital time across all reconstruction types.","ACKNLOWLEDGMENT This study was funded in part through the NIH/NCI Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA008748, which supports Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&#x27;s research infrastructure.

Breast-cancer management, from diagnosis to treatment and follow up, was a field that did not escape such changes, facing a challenging set of obstacles in order to maintain adequate cancer care services while diminishing viral spread among patients and personnel. In this review article, we discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on several aspects of breast-cancer management, and the subsequent modifications adopted by clinicians, scientific groups, and governments as a response to the novel conditions. Screening and diagnosis, as well as breast-cancer treatment paths-especially surgical interventions-were the most affected domains, while patients' psychological burden also emerged as a notable consequence. The aftermath of diagnostic and surgical delays is yet to be assessed, while the treatment alterations and the introduction of new therapeutic schemes might signify the opening of a novel era in breast-cancer management.",,This research received no external funding.,Cancers,,Cynthia Ma,,2022-10-31,2022,2022-10-31,,14,21,5360,All OA; Gold,Article,"Petropoulou, Zoe; Arkadopoulos, Nikolaos; Michalopoulos, Nikolaos V","Petropoulou, Zoe (4th Department of Surgery, Medical School, ""Attikon"" University Hospital, University of Athens, 12462 Athens, Greece.); Arkadopoulos, Nikolaos (4th Department of Surgery, Medical School, ""Attikon"" University Hospital, University of Athens, 12462 Athens, Greece.); Michalopoulos, Nikolaos V (4th Department of Surgery, Medical School, ""Attikon"" University Hospital, University of Athens, 12462 Athens, Greece.)","Petropoulou, Zoe (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens)","Petropoulou, Zoe (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens); Arkadopoulos, Nikolaos (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens); Michalopoulos, Nikolaos V (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens)",6,6,0.86,2.85,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/21/5360/pdf?version=1667190464,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152370255,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Methods: Our nationwide, retrospective study included patients who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer (International Codes of Diseases ICD)-10 C50) between Jan 1, 2011 and Dec 31, 2020. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates (ASRs) were calculated using European Standard Populations (ESP).
Results: 7,729 to 8,233 new breast cancer cases were recorded in the NHIF database annually, and 3,550 to 4,909 all-cause deaths occurred within BC population per year during 2011-2019 period, while 2,096 to 2,223 breast cancer cause-specific death was recorded (CSO). Age-standardized incidence rates varied between 116.73 and 106.16/100,000 PYs, showing a mean annual change of -0.7% (95% CI: -1.21%-0.16%) and a total change of -5.41% (95% CI: -9.24 to -1.32). Age-standardized mortality rates varied between 26.65-24.97/100,000 PYs (mean annual change: -0.58%; 95% CI: -1.31-0.27%; p=0.101; total change: -5.98%; 95% CI: -13.36-2.66). Age-specific incidence rates significantly decreased between 2011 and 2019 in women aged 50-59, 60-69, 80-89, and ≥90 years (-8.22%, -14.28%, -9.14%, and -36.22%, respectively), while it increased in young females by 30.02% (95%CI 17,01%- 51,97%) during the same period. From 2019 to 2020 (in first COVID-19 pandemic year), breast cancer incidence nominally decreased by 12% (incidence rate ratio [RR]: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.69-1.13; 2020 vs. 2019), all-cause mortality nominally increased by 6% (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.79-1.43) among breast cancer patients, and cause-specific mortality did not change (RR: 1.00; 95%CI: 0.86-1.15).
Conclusion: The incidence of breast cancer significantly decreased in older age groups (≥50 years), oppositely increased among young females between 2011 and 2019, while cause-specific mortality in breast cancer patients showed a non-significant decrease. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a nominal, but not statistically significant, 12% decrease in breast cancer incidence, with no significant increase in cause-specific breast cancer mortality observed during 2020.",We would like to thank Zsófia Barcza of Syntesia Medical Communications for medical writing support.,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,,13,,1182170,All OA;

METHODS: We examined the incidence of breast cancer cases at CoC sites using the U.S. Census population as the denominator. Breast cancer incidence was stratified by patient age, race and ethnicity, and geographic location.
RESULTS: A total of 1,499,806 patients with breast cancer were included. For females, breast cancer cases per 100,000 individuals went from 188 in 2015 to 203 in 2019 and then dropped to 176 in 2020 with a 15.7% decrease from 2019 to 2020. Breast cancer cases per 100,000 males went from 1.7 in 2015 to 1.8 in 2019 and then declined to 1.5 in 2020 with a 21.8% decrease from 2019 to 2020. For both females and males, cases per 100,000 individuals decreased from 2019 to 2020 for almost all age groups. For females, rates dropped from 2019 to 2020 for all races and ethnicities and geographic locations. The largest percent change was seen among Hispanic patients (-18.4%) and patients in the Middle Atlantic division (-18.6%). The stage distribution (0-IV) for female and male patients remained stable from 2018 to 2020.
CONCLUSION: The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decreased number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases at Commission on Cancer sites.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors report no conflicts of interest including relevant financial interests, activities, relationships, or affiliations.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on public life have additionally caused significant psychological distress for much of the population. It is therefore plausible that breast cancer patients might be particularly susceptible to the additional psychological stress caused by the pandemic, increasing suffering. In this study we therefore aimed to assess the level of psychological distress currently experienced by a defined group of breast cancer patients in our breast cancer centre, compared to distress levels pre-COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsFemale breast cancer patients of all ages receiving either adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative therapies were recruited for the study. All patients were screened for current or previous COVID-19 infection. The participants completed a self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire, the Stress and Coping Inventory (SCI), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) Distress Thermometer (DT), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30, and the BR23.ResultsEighty-two breast cancer patients were included. Therapy status and social demographic factors did not have a significant effect on the distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the DT pre and during COVID-19 pandemic did not differ significantly. Using the self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire, we detected three distinct subgroups demonstrating different levels of concerns in relation to SARS-CoV-2. The subgroup with the highest levels of concern reported significantly decreased life quality, related parameters and symptoms.ConclusionsThis monocentric study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected psychological health in a subpopulation of breast cancer patients. The application of a self-created “COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire” could potentially be used to help identify breast cancer patients who are susceptible to increased psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore may need additional intensive psychological support.Trial registrationDRKS-ID: DRKS00022507.",We thank Michaela Kapp for excellent technical assistance.,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,BMC Cancer,,,"Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Female; Germany; Humans; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",2021-12-31,2021,2021-12-31,2021-12,21,1,1356,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bartmann, Catharina; Fischer, Leah-Maria; Hübner, Theresa; Müller-Reiter, Max; Wöckel, Achim; McNeill, Rhiannon V.; Schlaiss, Tanja; Kittel-Schneider, Sarah; Kämmerer, Ulrike; Diessner, Joachim","Bartmann, Catharina (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 4, 97080, Würzburg, Germany); Fischer, Leah-Maria (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 4, 97080, Würzburg, Germany); Hübner, Theresa (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 4, 97080, Würzburg, Germany); Müller-Reiter, Max (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 4, 97080, Würzburg, Germany); Wöckel, Achim (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 4, 97080, Würzburg, Germany); McNeill, Rhiannon V.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the research team switched to an online survey. The survey included seven questions about breast cancer awareness, barriers to breast cancer screening, and screening status. We used residence information to attain the 9-digit zip code to link to the Area Deprivation Index at the Census Block Group neighborhood level. We report results as descriptive statistics of the barriers to mammography screening.ResultsThe 643 women represented 21 counties in Georgia, predominantly from metropolitan Atlanta, and 86% identified as Black. Among women aged 40 and older, 90% have ever had a mammogram. Among all women, 79% have ever had a mammogram, and 86% indicated that they would get a mammogram if offered in their neighborhood.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to understand the workplace environment of essential workers.
METHODS: We used data from a prospective cohort study of disparities in employment outcomes among women undergoing breast cancer treatment between 2010-2018 in New York City. We characterized participants as essential or non-essential based on self-reported occupation/industry and New York State executive orders issued during the pandemic. We compared job benefits and perceptions of workplace environment between groups.
RESULTS: There were 563 participants: 341 essential and 222 non-essential workers. Essential workers less frequently reported access to disability pay through work [n(%): 148 (58) versus 130 (73), p < 0.01]. Essential workers in unions had greater availability of sick leave and disability pay than non-unionized essential workers (86% versus 53%, p < 0.01, and 76% versus 46%, p < 0.01, respectively). Health insurance differed by essential worker status (p < 0.01): essential workers more frequently had public insurance (29% versus 18%). Surprisingly, in multivariable analyses controlling for age, race/ethnicity, income, education, chemotherapy receipt, and comfort with English, essential workers were less likely to say their employer had treated them unfairly (p < 0.01). However, minorities were less likely to say their employer was accommodating (p = 0.03) and more likely to say their employer had treated them unfairly (p < 0.01) than Non-Latina Whites.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified vulnerabilities in workplace protections, particularly among essential workers not in unions. Minority women more often had negative perceptions of their work environment, possibly reflecting employer bias.","This work was supported by the American Cancer Society (MRSGT-11-002-01-CPHPS), American Society of Clinical Oncology (career development award), National Cancer Institute (R37 CA214785), City College of New York/Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Partnership for Cancer Research Training and Community Outreach (U54 CA137788), and Department of Health and Human Services (Cancer Center Support grant P30 CA 008748, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center).",,Work,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Workplace,2022-04-21,2022,2022-04-21,2022,71,4,815-823,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Klugman, Madelyn; Patil, Sujata; Gany, Francesca; Blinder, Victoria","Klugman, Madelyn (Department of Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA); Patil, Sujata (Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA); Gany, Francesca (Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA); Blinder, Victoria (Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA)","Klugman, Madelyn (NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital)","Klugman, Madelyn (NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital); Patil, Sujata (Cleveland Clinic; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center); Gany, Francesca (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center); Blinder, Victoria (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center)",3,3,0.57,2.44,https://content.iospress.com:443/download/work/wor211095?id=work%2Fwor211095,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146063471,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems",

In June 2020, they resumed, calling for mandatory safe procedures to properly manage patients and staff.
METHODS: A protocol supporting medical activities in breast cancer screening was created, based on six relevant articles published in the literature and in the following National and International guidelines for COVID-19 prevention. The patient population, consisting of both screening and breast ambulatory patients, was classified into one of four categories: 1. Non-COVID-19 patient; 2. Confirmed COVID-19 in an asymptomatic screening patient; 3. suspected COVID-19 in symptomatic or confirmed breast cancer; 4. Confirmed COVID-19 in symptomatic or confirmed breast cancer. The day before the radiological exam, patients are screened for COVID-19 infection through a telephone questionnaire. At a subsequent in person appointment, the body temperature is checked and depending on the clinical scenario at stake, the scenario-specific procedures for medical and paramedical staff are adopted.
RESULTS: In total, 203 mammograms, 76 breast ultrasound exams, 4 core needle biopsies, and 6 vacuum-assisted breast biopsies were performed in one month. Neither medical nor paramedical staff were infected on any of these occasions.
CONCLUSION: Our department organization model can represent a case of implementation of National and International guidelines applied in a breast cancer screening program, assisting hospital personnel into COVID-19 infection prevention.","This research and its authors did not receive any specific grant neither from funding agencies in the public, commercial, nor from not-for-profit sectors or any other provider.",This research received no external funding.,Journal of Personalized Medicine,,Franco M.

The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term impact of this interruption on delay in detection, tumour size of screen-detected breast cancers, and interval cancer rate. After validation, the micro-simulation model SiMRiSc was used to calculate the effects of interruption of the breast cancer screening program for three months and for hypothetical interruptions of six and twelve months. A scenario without interruption was used as reference. Outcomes considered were tumour size of screen-detected breast cancers and interval cancer rate. Women of 55-59 and 60-64 years old at time of interruption were considered. Uncertainties were estimated using a sensitivity analysis. The three-month interruption had no clinically relevant long-term effect on the tumour size of screen-detected breast cancers. A 19% increase in interval cancer rate was found between last screening before and first screening after interruption compared to no interruption. Hypothetical interruptions of six and twelve months resulted in larger increases in interval cancer rate of 38% and 78% between last screening before and first screening after interruption, respectively, and an increase in middle-sized tumours in first screening after interruption of 26% and 47%, respectively. In conclusion, the interruption of the Dutch screening program is not expected to result in a long-term delay in detection or clinically relevant change in tumour size of screen-detected cancers, but only affects the interval cancer rate between last screening before and first screening after interruption.",None.,K.

METHODS: Google Trends (trends.google.com) was utilized to assess public interest in multiple cancer types. We then constructed a forecasting model to determine the expected search interest had the pandemic not occurred. We then compared our models to actual screening usage during the pandemic.
RESULTS: Public interest in cancer screenings decreased precipitously at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the Google Trends estimated the decrease in mammogram usage 25.8% below the actual value. Similarly, Google Trends estimated the decrease in colon cancer screening usage 9.7% below the true value.
DISCUSSION: We found the decrease in public interest in breast and colon cancer screenings slightly underestimated the actual screening usage numbers, suggesting Google Trends may be utilized as an indicator for human behavior regarding cancer screening, particularly with colon and breast cancer screenings. If the negative trend in cancer screening continues and missed screenings are not appropriately corrected for, socioeconomic and racial disparities in cancer diagnoses, morbidity, and mortality will widen.","Benjamin Greiner: Conceptualization, methodology, data curation, writing original draft, reviewing final draft, and supervision.

Objective: To describe utilization of women's preventive health services.
Design Setting and Participants: Cross-sectional study of women aged 18 to 74 years enrolled in a commercial health maintenance organization in Michigan.
Exposures: COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2020).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of receiving breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening, long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) insertions, and pharmacy-obtained contraception, adjusted for month, age, county, zip code characteristics (per-capita income, non-White percentage of population, non-English-proficient percentage of population), and plan designation (primary plan holder vs dependent).
Results: The study population included 685 373 women aged 18 to 74 years, enrolled for 13 000 715 person-months, of whom 10 061 275 person-months (77.4%) were among women aged 25 to 64 years and 8 020 215 (61.7%) were the primary plan holder, with mean zip code per capita income of $33 708, 20.2% mean zip code non-White population, and 3.4% mean zip code non-English-speaking population. For services requiring an in-person visit (breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, STI testing, and LARC insertions), utilization declined by 60% to 90% during the spring of 2020, with a nadir in April 2020, after which utilization for all services recovered to close to 2019 levels by July 2020. Claims for pharmacy-obtained hormonal contraceptives in 2020 were consistently 15% to 30% lower than 2019. The AORs of a woman receiving a given preventive service in 2020 compared with 2019 were significantly lower for breast cancer screening (AOR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79-0.80), cervical cancer screening (AOR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.80-0.81), STI screening (AOR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.82-0.84), LARC insertion (AOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.90), and pharmacy-obtained contraception (AOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.72-0.74) (all P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of women enrolled in a large US commercial health maintenance organization plan, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with large but transient declines in rates of breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, STI screening, and LARC insertions, and moderate persistent declines in pharmacy-obtained hormonal contraceptives. The overall odds of a woman receiving a given preventive service in 2020 was 20% to 30% lower than 2019.

Our objectives were to estimate: 1) the COVID-19 affected period, 2) the proportion of pandemic-associated missed or delayed screening encounters, and 3) pandemic-associated patient attrition in screening encounters overall and by sociodemographic subgroup.
METHODS: We included screening mammogram encounter EPIC data from 1-1-2019 to 12-31-2022 for females ≥40 years old. We used Bayesian State Space models to describe weekly screening mammogram counts, modeling an interruption that phased in and out between 3-1-2020 and 9-1-2020. We used the posterior predictive distribution to model differences between a predicted, uninterrupted process and the observed screening mammogram counts. We estimated associations between race/ethnicity and age group and return screening mammogram encounters during the pandemic among those with 2019 encounters using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Our analysis modeling weekly screening mammogram counts included 231,385 encounters (n = 127,621 women). Model-estimated screening mammograms dropped by >98% between 03-15-2020 and 05-24-2020 followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels or higher with similar results by race/ethnicity and age group. Among 79,257 women, non-Hispanic (NH) Asians, NH Blacks, and Hispanics had significantly (p < .05) lower odds of screening encounter returns during 2020-2022 vs. NH Whites with odds ratios (ORs) from 0.70 to 0.91. Among 79,983 women, those 60-69 had significantly higher odds of any return screening encounter during 2020-2022 (OR = 1.28), while those ≥80 and 40-49 had significantly lower odds (ORs 0.77, 0.45) than those 50-59 years old. A sensitivity analysis suggested a possible pre-existing pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a short-term pandemic effect on screening mammograms of ~2 months with no evidence of disparities. However, we observed racial/ethnic disparities in screening mammogram returns during the pandemic that may be at least partially pre-existing. These results may inform future pandemic planning and continued efforts to eliminate mammogram screening disparities.",,"This work was supported by a just-in-time award through NIH CTSA Grant #UL1 TR002345 and through the Neidorff Family and Centene Corporation COVID & Health Disparity Response Fund.

Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2018 and 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data sets. We defined adherence to screenings according to the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for breast and cervical cancer screening. The analysis included respondents assigned female at birth, aged 50 to 74 years (breast cancer screening) or aged 21 to 65 years (cervical cancer screening). We performed logistic regression to evaluate breast and cervical cancer screening adherence, by disability status and SDOH (health insurance coverage, marital status, and urban residency), independently and simultaneously.
Results: Our analysis included 27,526 BRFSS respondents in 2018 and 2020. In 2018, women with disabilities had lower adjusted odds than women without disabilities of being up to date with mammograms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.76, 95% CI, 0.63-0.93) and Pap (Papanicolaou) tests (AOR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89). In 2020, among women with disabilities, the adjusted odds of mammogram and Pap test adherence decreased (AOR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.89; AOR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75, respectively). In 2018, the adjusted odds of mammogram adherence among rural residents with and without disabilities were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.98), which decreased to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.93) in 2020.
Conclusion: The findings of this study highlight the effect of disability status and SDOH on breast and cervical cancer screening rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health strategies that acknowledge and address these disparities are crucial in preparing for future public health crises.","Acknowledgments

Many nonurgent surgeries are delayed to preserve hospital resources, and patient visits to health care settings are limited to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Providers must carefully weigh risks and benefits of delivering immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic. For breast cancer, a key difference is increased use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy due to deferral of many breast surgeries during the pandemic. In some cases, this necessitates increased use of genomic tumor profiling on core biopsy specimens to guide neoadjuvant therapy decisions. Breast cancer treatment during the pandemic requires multidisciplinary input and varies according to stage, tumor biology, comorbidities, age, patient preferences, and available hospital resources. We present here the Johns Hopkins Women's Malignancies Program approach to breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. We include algorithms based on tumor biology and extent of disease that guide management decisions during the pandemic. These algorithms emphasize medical oncology treatment decisions and demonstrate how we have operationalized the general treatment recommendations during the pandemic proposed by national groups, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic Breast Cancer Consortium. Our recommendations can be adapted by other institutions and medical oncology practices in accordance with local conditions and resources. Guidelines such as these will be important as we continue to balance treatment of breast cancer against risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection until approval of a vaccine.",,,JCO Oncology Practice,,,"Betacoronavirus;

Racial and other sociodemographic inequities in routine cancer screening are well-documented, but less is known about how these long-standing inequities were impacted by the disruption in health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early in the pandemic, cancer screening and other prevention services were suspended or delayed, and these disruptions may have had to disproportionate impact on some sociodemographic groups. We tested the hypothesis that inequities in screening mammography widened during the pandemic.MethodsA secondary analysis of patient data from a large state-wide, non-profit healthcare system in Washington State. Analyses were based on two mutually exclusive cohorts of women 50 years or older. The first cohort (n = 18,197) were those women screened in 2017 who would have been due for repeat screening in 2019 (prior to the pandemic’s onset). The second cohort (n = 16,391) were women screened in 2018 due in 2020. Explanatory variables were obtained from patient records and included race/ethnicity, age, rural or urban residence, and insurance type. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds of two-year screening for each cohort separately. Combining both cohorts, interaction models were used to test for differences in inequities before and during the pandemic.ResultsSignificant sociodemographic differences in screening were confirmed during the pandemic, but these were similar to those that existed prior. Based on interaction models, women using Medicaid insurance and of Asian race experienced significantly steeper declines in screening than privately insured and white women (Odds ratios [95% CI] of 0.74 [0.58–0.95] and 0.76 [0.59–0.97] for Medicaid and Asian race, respectively). All other sociodemographic inequities in screening during 2020 were not significantly different from those in 2019.ConclusionsOur findings confirm inequities for screening mammograms during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide evidence that these largely reflect the inequities in screening that were present before the pandemic. Policies and interventions to tackle long-standing inequities in use of preventive services may help ensure continuity of care for all, but especially for racial and ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.",None.,"This study was supported by a grant from the Andy Hill Foundation, Washington State’s Cancer Research Endowment.",Breast Cancer,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Pandemics; Socioeconomic Factors; United States,2022-04-02,2022,2022-04-02,2022-07,29,4,740-746,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Monsivais, Pablo; Amiri, Solmaz; Robison, Jeanne; Pflugeisen, Chaya; Kordas, Gordon; Amram, Ofer","Monsivais, Pablo (Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology, Elson S.

METHODS: The proposed treatment schemes, favoring hypofractionated schedules, and COVID-19 management strategies regarding irradiation are presented. Attendance after two months of implementation of these policies was measured and compared with that during the same period in 2019.
RESULTS: A 10% reduction in the number of treated patients and a 26% reduction in the number of sessions was observed. The main impact was a decrease in the treatment of benign diseases and gastrointestinal tumors, with a general increase in breast cancer treatments. Eighteen (1.7%) patients were confirmed as having COVID-19 during radiotherapy in April and May 2020, three of whom were hospitalized, and one patient died because of COVID-19. Among the 18 patients, 12 had their treatments interrupted for at least 15 days from symptom appearance.
CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the number of treated patients in our radiotherapy department, with a greater decrease in the total number of sessions. This indicated, overall, a smaller number of fractions/patients treated, despite our efforts to maintain the treatment routine. We had several patients who were infected with COVID-19 and one related death during treatment in the first few months of the pandemic in São Paulo Brazil.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Ms. Katia Brito de Araujo, radiation therapist, for help with data collection.",,Clinics,,,"Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; Brazil; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Outpatients; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiotherapy; SARS-CoV-2",2020-11-06,2020,2020-11-06,2020,75,,e2298,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Andrade Carvalho, Heloisa; Vasconcelos, Karina Gondim Moutinho C.; Gomes, Herbeni Cardoso; Salvajoli, João Víctor","de Andrade Carvalho, Heloisa (Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo (ICESP), Instituto de Radiologia (InRad), Serviço de Radioterapia, Hospital das Clinicas (HCFMUSP), Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, SP, BR); Vasconcelos, Karina Gondim Moutinho C.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic might exacerbate these disparities as supply and demand for screening services are reduced. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) provides cancer screening services to women with low income and inadequate health insurance. We examined COVID-19's impact on NBCCEDP screening services during January-June 2020. We found the total number of NBCCEDP-funded breast and cervical cancer screening tests declined by 87% and 84%, respectively, during April 2020 compared with the previous 5-year averages for that month. The extent of declines varied by geography, race/ethnicity, and rurality. In April 2020, screening test volume declined most severely in Health and Human Services Region 2 - New York (96% for breast, 95% for cervical cancer screening) compared to the previous 5-year averages. The greatest declines were among American Indian/Alaskan Native women for breast cancer screening (98%) and Asian Pacific Islander women for cervical cancer screening (92%). Test volume began to recover in May and, by June 2020, NBCCEDP breast and cervical cancer screening test volume was 39% and 40% below the 5-year average for that month, respectively. However, breast cancer screening remained over 50% below the 5-year average among women in rural areas.

Objective: To investigate the pandemic's association with cancer screening worldwide.
Data Sources: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021.
Study Selection: Observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries that compared the number of screening tests performed before and during the pandemic for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer were included.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data from the selected studies. The weighted average of the percentage variation was calculated between the 2 periods to assess the change in the number of cancer screening tests performed during the pandemic. Stratified analysis was performed by geographic area, period, and type of setting. The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the weighted average percentage variation in the number of screening tests performed between January and October 2020 compared with the previous period.
Results: The review comprised 39 publications. There was an overall decrease of -46.7% (95% CI, -55.5% to -37.8%) for breast cancer screening, -44.9% (95% CI, -53.8% to -36.1%) for colorectal cancer screening, and -51.8% (95% CI, -64.7% to -38.9%) for cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. For all 3 cancers, a U-shaped temporal trend was identified; for colorectal cancer, a significant decrease was still apparent after May 2020 (in June to October, the decrease was -23.4% [95% CI, -44.4% to -2.4%]). Differences by geographic area and screening setting were also identified.
Conclusions and Relevance: A summary estimate of the downscaling of cancer screening tests since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This could be associated with an increase in the number of avoidable cancer deaths. Effective interventions are required to restore the capacity of screening services to the prepandemic level.",,,JAMA Oncology,,,COVID-19; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,2022-09-01,2022,2022-09-15,2022-09-01,8,9,1287-1293,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Teglia, Federica; Angelini, Marco; Astolfi, Laura; Casolari, Giulia; Boffetta, Paolo","Teglia, Federica (Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy); Angelini, Marco (Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy); Astolfi, Laura (Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy); Casolari, Giulia (Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy); Boffetta, Paolo (Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Stony Brook Cancer Center, Stony Brook University, New York, New York)","Boffetta, Paolo (University of Bologna; Stony Brook University)","Teglia, Federica (University of Bologna); Angelini, Marco (University of Bologna); Astolfi, Laura (University of Bologna); Casolari, Giulia (University of Bologna); Boffetta, Paolo (University of Bologna; Stony Brook University)",72,65,7.59,34.15,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/articlepdf/2794149/jamaoncology_teglia_2022_oi_220032_1663179782.72506.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149305771,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

The current study set out to examine the effect of delays to scheduled oncology services on emotional and cognitive vulnerability in women with a breast cancer diagnosis in Iran, one of the very first countries to be heavily impacted by COVID-19. One hundred thirty-nine women with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer answered a series of online questionnaires to assess the current state of rumination, worry, and cognitive vulnerability as well as the emotional impact of COVID-19 on their mental health. Results indicated that delays in accessing oncology services significantly increased COVID related emotional vulnerability. Regression analyses revealed that after controlling for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, women's COVID related emotional vulnerability explained higher levels of ruminative response and chronic worry as well as poorer cognitive function. This study is the first in Iran to demonstrate that the effects of COVID-19 on emotional health amongst women affected by breast cancer can exaggerate anxiety and depressive related symptoms increasing risks for clinical levels of these disorders. Our findings call for an urgent need to address these risks using targeted interventions exercising resilience.","We thank Drs.

As the pandemic has affected countries differently, we aimed to quantify changes in breast screening volume and uptake during the first year of COVID-19 . We systematically searched Medline, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database, and governmental databases. Studies covering January 2020 to March 2022 were included. We extracted and analyzed data regarding study methodology, screening volume, and uptake. To assess for risk of bias, we used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool. Twenty-six cross-sectional descriptive studies (focusing on 13 countries/nations) were included out of 935 independent records. Reductions in screening volume and uptake rates were observed among eight countries. Changes in screening participation volume in five nations with national population-based screening ranged from -13 to -31%. Among two countries with limited population-based programs, the decline ranged from -61 to -41%. Within the USA, population participation volumes varied ranging from +18 to -39%, with suggestion of differences by insurance status (HMO, Medicare, and low-income programs). Almost all studies had high risk of bias due to insufficient statistical analysis and confounding factors. The extent of COVID-19-induced reduction in breast screening participation volume differed by region and data suggested potential differences by healthcare setting (e.g., national health insurance vs. private healthcare). Recovery efforts should monitor access to screening and early diagnosis to determine whether prevention services need strengthening to increase the coverage of disadvantaged groups and reduce disparities.","This manuscript was prepared or accomplished by Jonine Figueroa in their personal capacity.

Numerous studies reported an early decline in breast cancer (BC) incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Less evidence is available on changes in medical care. Reports from individual patients have provided anecdotal evidence for a shift from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy to reduce the number of visits to radiation units during the pandemic. This study aimed to explore changes in BC incidence and surgical treatment in the south of Germany. Using data from the Baden-Württemberg Cancer Registry, the age-standardized incidence of BC (ICD-10 C50 and D05) (women) in 2018–2021 was investigated overall and by age and stage using standardized incidence ratios. Among pre-operative stage I/IIA BC patients, differences in the time to surgery and type of surgery were investigated using negative binomial and logistic regression models. The incidence of invasive BC decreased significantly from 170.9 per 100,000 women in 2018/2019 to 159.7 in 2020 and increased to 169.2 in 2021. This decrease resulted from a lower incidence around April 2020 and was also observed for non-invasive BC. In 2021, incidence of invasive BC was still decreased by 8% in women aged 80 + years. Surgical treatment was analyzed in 22,708 BC patients with a pre-operative stage ≤ IIA. The median time to surgery was 33 days in 2018/2019, 32 days in 2020 and 36 days in 2021. The proportion of mastectomies increased from 16.1% in 2018/2019 to 17.1% in 2020 and 17.3% in 2021 (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (2021 vs. 2018/2019): 1.13 (1.03–1.24)). The adjusted increase was strongest for patients aged 50–59 years (1.34 (1.09–1.64)) and those with high-grade tumors (1.27 (1.07–1.51)). While the early return to pre-pandemic age-standardized BC incidence rates is promising, missed cases have not been caught up until 2021. Furthermore, the decreased incidence in elderly women in 2021 warrants further attention. In early-stage BC, a slightly greater rate of mastectomies was observed, although such a change was not recommended. This result underlines the importance of good communication of adapted treatment guidelines in such exceptional circumstances.","We would like to thank all cancer reporting facilities and cancer patients for providing the data.

In April 2021, the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), which provides health care to 68.5 million people, launched the National Strategy for Health Services Recovery (Recovery policy). The study objective was to evaluate whether the Recovery policy addressed COVID-related declines in maternal, child health, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) services.
Methods: We analysed the data of 35 IMSS delegations from January 2019 to November 2021 on contraceptive visits, antenatal care consultations, deliveries, caesarean sections, sick children's consultations, child vaccination, breast and cervical cancer screening, diabetes and hypertension consultations, and control. We focused on the period before (April 2020 - March 2021) and during (April 2021 - November 2021) the Recovery policy and used an interrupted time series design and Poisson Generalized Estimating Equation models to estimate the association of this policy with service use and outcomes and change in their trends.
Results: Despite the third wave of the pandemic in 2021, service utilization increased in the Recovery period, reaching (at minimum) 49% of pre-pandemic levels for sick children's consultations and (at maximum) 106% of pre-pandemic levels for breast cancer screenings. Evidence for the Recovery policy role was mixed: the policy was associated with increased facility deliveries (IRR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.11-1.19) with a growing trend over time (IRR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.03-1.05); antenatal care and child health services saw strong level effects but decrease over time. Additionally, the Recovery policy was associated with diabetes and hypertension control. Services recovery varied across delegations.
Conclusions: Health service utilization and NCDs control demonstrated important gains in 2021, but evidence suggests the policy had inconsistent effects across services and decreasing impact over time. Further efforts to strengthen essential health services and ensure consistent recovery across delegations are warranted.","Ethical approval: The study was approved by the IMSS National Research and Ethics Committee (registry number R-2020-785-034).

Rates of cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment decreased significantly in the US and other developed nations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown (April 2020) and have since recovered, although not to baseline levels in many cases. For breast cancer, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening with mammography for women aged 50−74, while the ACS recommends annual screening for women aged 45−54, who may transition to biennial after 55. Minority and rural populations have lower rates of screening and lower utilization of DBT, which offers superior sensitivity and specificity. Among 20 US health networks in April 2020, mammography rates were down 89.2% and new breast cancer diagnoses down by 50.5%. For cervical cancer, the USPSTF recommends cervical cytology every three years for women 21−65, or cytology+hrHPV co-testing every five years for women aged 30−65. Cervical cancer screening rates declined by 87% in April 2020 and recovered to a 40% decline by June 2020, with American Indians and Asians most severely affected. For colorectal cancer (CRC), the USPSTF and ACS recommend screening for ages 45−75, recently lowered from a starting age of 50. Most commonly-used modalities include annual FIT testing, FIT+DNA testing every three years, and colonoscopy every ten years, with shorter repeat if polyps are found. In the US, CRC screenings were down by 79−84.5% in April 2020 across several retrospective studies. Patient encounters for CRC were down by 39.9%, and a UK-based model predicted that 5-year-survival would decrease by 6.4%. The USPSTF recommends screening low dose CT scans (LDCTs) for ages 50−80 with a >20 pack-year smoking history who have smoked within the past 15 years. In April 2020, screening LDCTs fell by 72−78% at one US institution and lung cancer diagnoses were down 39.1%.",,This research received no external funding.,Medical Sciences,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2022-03-01,2022,2022-03-01,,10,1,16,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barsouk, Adam; Saginala, Kalyan; Aluru, John Sukumar; Rawla, Prashanth; Barsouk, Alexander","Barsouk, Adam (Hillman Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA;, adambarsouk@comcast.net); Saginala, Kalyan (Plains Regional Medical Group Internal Medicine, Clovis, NM 88101, USA;, drsaginala@gmail.com); Aluru, John Sukumar (Senior Research Associate, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02212, USA;, jaluru@bidmc.harvard.edu); Rawla, Prashanth (Hospitalist, Parrish Medical Center, Titusville, FL 32796, USA); Barsouk, Alexander (Hematologist-Oncologist, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA 15212, USA;, alexbarsouk@comcast.net)","Rawla, Prashanth (Hospitalist, Parrish Medical Center, Titusville, FL 32796, USA)","Barsouk, Adam (UPMC Hillman Cancer Center); Saginala, Kalyan (Plains Regional Medical Group Internal Medicine, Clovis, NM 88101, USA;, drsaginala@gmail.com); Aluru, John Sukumar (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University); Rawla, Prashanth (Hospitalist, Parrish Medical Center, Titusville, FL 32796, USA); Barsouk, Alexander (Allegheny Health Network)",22,19,2.01,13.13,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3271/10/1/16/pdf?version=1646123157,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145963015,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Data on telemedicine utilization are lacking, and racial/ethnic disparities in utilization and satisfaction are unknown among breast cancer patients. Methods: This was a longitudinal study, with two surveys conducted in 2020 and 2021, among patients enrolled in the Chicago Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort. Telemedicine utilization was modeled using mixed-effects logistic regression. Telemedicine satisfaction, assessed using a 5-point Likert scale, was modeled using mixed-effects proportional odds regression. Qualitative data on satisfaction were coded and analyzed using grounded theory. Results: Of 1,721 respondents, most (70.3%) were White, followed by 23.6% Black, 3.1% Asian, and 3.0% Hispanic. The median duration from breast cancer diagnosis to survey was 5.5 years (interquartile range: 2.7-9.4). In 2020, 59.2% reported telemedicine use; in 2021, 64.9% did, with a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001). Black patients had greater odds of telemedicine use than White patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.05). In 2020, 90.3% reported somewhat-to-extreme satisfaction; in 2021, 91.2% did, with a statistically significant, although clinically small, increase (p = 0.038). There were no racial/ethnic differences in telemedicine satisfaction between Black (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.81-1.35), Asian (AOR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.34-1.16), or Hispanic (AOR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.33-1.21) and White patients. Major themes emerged from the respondents that explained their levels of satisfaction were convenience, safety, specialty dependence, and technical issues. Conclusions: Telemedicine utilization and satisfaction were high among breast cancer patients over time and across races/ethnicities. Telemedicine could have great potential in reducing barriers to care and promoting health equity for breast cancer patients. However, patients' perceived challenges in accessing high-quality virtual care should be addressed.",We are grateful to the participants enrolled in the Chicago Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort.

Resources were shifted to COVID-19 patients, screening programs were temporary suspended, and oncological care suffered slow-down. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of these measures on breast cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All breast cancer patients referred to our unit from February 21, 2019 to February 21, 2021 were enrolled. Type of treatments and surgery, TNM, tumor diameter, and predictive and prognostic factors were analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 445 patients with a breast cancer diagnosis, 182 (40.9%) were enrolled in the COVID-19 group (from February 21, 2010 to February 21, 2021). These patients were compared with 263 (59.1%) patients pre-COVID-19. Tumor diameters were bigger in the COVID-19 group. Type of surgery and N staging were statistically significantly different. Extreme advanced disease incidence was significantly different between the groups (2.7% COVID-19 group vs. 0 pre-COVID-19 group, p=0.011). Incidence of post-surgical radiation-therapy was higher in the COVID-19 group. Other variables analyzed were comparable without a statistically significant difference.

METHODS: Eligible women (N = 39,444) were aged ≥18 years and received a screening mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, or breast biopsy between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020, at 7 academic and community breast imaging facilities in North Carolina. Changes in the number of mammography or breast biopsy examinations after March 3, 2020 (the first COVID-19 diagnosis in North Carolina) were evaluated and compared with the expected numbers based on trends between January 1, 2019 and March 2, 2020. Changes in the predicted mean monthly number of examinations were estimated using interrupted time series models. Differences in patient characteristics were tested using least squares means regression.
RESULTS: Fewer examinations than expected were received after the pandemic's onset. Maximum reductions occurred in March 2020 for screening mammography (-85.1%; 95% CI, -100.0%, -70.0%) and diagnostic mammography (-48.9%; 95% CI, -71.7%, -26.2%) and in May 2020 for biopsies (-40.9%; 95% CI, -57.6%, -24.3%). The deficit decreased gradually, with no significant difference between observed and expected numbers by July 2020 (diagnostic mammography) and August 2020 (screening mammography and biopsy). Several months after the pandemic's onset, women who were receiving care had higher predicted breast cancer risk (screening mammography, P < .001) and more commonly lacked insurance (diagnostic mammography, P < .001; biopsy, P < .001) compared with the prepandemic population.
CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-associated deficits in the number of breast examinations decreased over time. Utilization differed by breast cancer risk and insurance status, but not by age or race/ethnicity. Long-term studies are needed to clarify the contribution of these trends to breast cancer disparities.",Conflict of Interest Disclosures The authors made no disclosures.,The funding source had no role in the research design or interpretation of the data.

This technology has been a popular topic of research over the past decade and is viewed as a promising treatment strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, despite being the most prevalent malignant disease for women worldwide, breast cancer patients have limited access to immunotherapy benefits. mRNA vaccination has the potential to convert cold breast cancer into hot and expand the responders. Effective mRNA vaccine design for in vivo function requires consideration of vaccine targets, mRNA structures, transport vectors, and injection routes.

This study assessed the impact of the pandemic on breast cancer (BC) incidence, stage at diagnosis, and management in Belgium in 2020.MethodsAll Belgian residents diagnosed with in situ or invasive BC in 2015–2020 in the nationwide, population-based cancer registry database were included. Incidence trends for 2015–2019 were extrapolated to predict incidence and stage distribution for 2020 and compared with the observed values. National healthcare reimbursement data were used to examine treatment strategies. Exact tumor diameter and nodal involvement, extracted from pathology reports, were analyzed for 2019 and 2020.Results74,975 tumors were selected for analysis of incidence and clinical stage. Invasive BC incidence declined by -5.0% in 2020, with a drop during the first COVID-19 wave (Mar-Jun; -23%) followed by a rebound (Jul-Dec; +7%). Predicted and observed incidence (in situ + invasive) was not different in patients < 50 years. In the 50–69 and 70 + age groups, significant declines of -4.1% and − 8.4% respectively were found. Excess declines were seen in clinical stage 0 and I in Mar-Jun, without excess increases in clinical stage II-IV tumors in Jul-Dec. There was no increase in average tumor diameter or nodal involvement in 2020. Patients diagnosed in Mar-Jun received significantly more neoadjuvant therapy, particularly neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for patients with clinical stage I-II BC.ConclusionsBC incidence decline in 2020 in Belgium was largely restricted to very early-stage BC and patients aged 50 and over. Delayed diagnosis did not result in an overall progression to higher stage at diagnosis in 2020. Observed treatment adaptations in Belgium were successful in prioritizing patients for surgery while preventing tumor progression in those with surgical delay. Continuation of monitoring BC incidence and stage in the future is crucial.","We wish to express special appreciation to the 11 hospitals that participated in the manual extraction of tumor diameter and node involvement for this study, namely: UZ Leuven (Leuven), CHU de Liège (Liège), AZ Sint-Blasius (Dendermonde), Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (Genk), Jessa Ziekenhuis (Hasselt), OLV Ziekenhuis (Aalst), Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Bruxelles), UZ Gent (Gent), UZ Antwerpen (Antwerpen), UZ Brussel (Brussel), and AZ Groeninge (Kortrijk).

We aimed to explore the treatment changes and delays of early breast cancer (EBC) during the first quarter of 2020.
METHODS: We did this retrospective, multicentre, cohort study at 97 cancer centres in China. EBC patients who received treatment regardless of preoperative therapy, surgery or postoperative therapy during first quarter of 2020 were included.
FINDINGS: 8397 patients were eligible with a median age of 50 (IQR 43-56). 0·2% (15/8397) of EBC patients were confirmed as COVID-19 infection. Only 5·2% of breast cancer diagnosis occurred after quarantine in Hubei compared with 15·3% in other provinces (OR= 0·30, 95%CI 0·24-0·38). postoperative endocrine therapy were least affected compared with different regions after quarantine (OR=0·37 [95%CI 0·19-0·73]). The proportion of surgery decreased from 16·4% in December last year to 2·6% in February in Hubei. Compared with intervals from diagnosis to treatment before quarantine restrictions, the average time increased with significance from 3·5 to 7·7 days in Hubei and 5·7 to 7·7 days in other provinces (p< 0·001). There were also 18·5 and 7·2 days delay in Hubei and other provinces respectively when calculating interval from surgery to postoperative therapy.
INTERPRETATION: EBC from high risk regions had a comparative rate of COVID-19 infection. After implementation of COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, fewer diagnosis and surgery with significant delays were seen when compared with treatment before.

Here we show a comparative analysis of the microbiome from naso-oropharyngeal samples of breast cancer patients with respect to SARS-CoV-2 status and identified bacteria associated with symptom severity. Total DNA of naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 74 women with or without breast cancer, positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 were PCR-amplified for 16S-rDNA V3 and V4 regions and submitted to massive parallel sequencing. Sequencing data were analyzed with QIIME2 and taxonomic identification was performed using the q2-feature-classifier QIIME2 plugin, the Greengenes Database, and amplicon sequence variants (ASV) analysis. A total of 486 different bacteria were identified. No difference was found in taxa diversity between sample groups. Cluster analysis did not group the samples concerning SARS-CoV-2 status, breast cancer diagnosis, or symptom severity. Three taxa (Pseudomonas, Moraxella, and Klebsiella,) showed to be overrepresented in women with breast cancer and positive for SARS-CoV-2 when compared to the other women groups, and five bacterial groups were associated with COVID-19 severity among breast cancer patients: Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Scardovia, Parasegitibacter luogiensis, and Thermomonas. The presence of Staphylococcus in COVID-19 breast cancer patients may possibly be a consequence of nosocomial infection.","The authors are grateful to INCA health workers (doctors, nurses, nursing technicians and general cleaning services); and the members of INCA COVID-19 Task Force: Luiza M.

PCP participants in the Duke University Health System, federally qualified health center, corporate employee health and community practices, nearby academic medical center, Duke physician assistant and advanced practice nurse leadership program alumni were first selected in a convenience sample and for semi-structured interviews (n = 11). Based on these data, an online survey tool was developed and disseminated (n = 78) to assess salient measures of IBC diagnosis, health disparity factors, referral and care coordination practices, COVID-19 impact, and continuing medical education (CME). PCP reported access to care and knowledge gaps in symptom recognition (mean = 3.3, range 1-7) as major barriers. Only 31 % reported ever suspecting IBC in a patient. PCP (n = 49) responded being challenged with referral delays in diagnostic imaging. Additionally, since the COVID-19 pandemic started, 63 % reported breast cancer referral delays, and 33 % reported diagnosing less breast cancer. PCP stated interest in CME in their practice for improved diagnosis and patient care, which included online (53 %), lunch time or other in-service training (33 %), patient and provider-facing websites (32 %). Challenges communicating rare cancer information, gaps in confidence in diagnosing IBC, and timely follow-up with patients and specialists underscores the need for developing PCP educational modules to improve guideline-concordant care.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

How to best perform these treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be established.
Patients and Methods: Patients with breast cancer who received SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening before cancer treatment from December 2020 to April 2021 were included. PCR screening was performed within 72 hours of the scheduled admission time and treatment.
Results: A total of 19 tests in 15 patients were analysed. Fourteen cases displayed no symptoms, and five cases had some symptoms. COVID PCR tests were negative in all cases.
Conclusion: COVID-19 screening can ensure that breast cancer patients do not miss scheduled treatments as a result of the pandemic. Diagnosis of patients with symptoms that are shared by COVID-19 infection, chemotherapy, and breast cancer recurrence must be performed carefully.",,,Cancer Diagnosis & Prognosis,,,,2021-11-03,2021,2021-11-03,2021-11-03,1,5,423-425,All OA; Green,Article,"Yoshimoto, Nobuyasu; Takayama, Satoru; Sakamoto, Masaki; Ishikawa, Ken; Katada, Takeyasu; Kawate, Akifumi; Takura, Kohei; Takayama, Shoryu; Yamashita, Masakatsu; Yamamoto, Shinya; Yokoyama, Kioto; Kani, Hisanori","Yoshimoto, Nobuyasu (Department of Breast Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Takayama, Satoru (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Sakamoto, Masaki (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Ishikawa, Ken (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Katada, Takeyasu (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Kawate, Akifumi (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Takura, Kohei (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Takayama, Shoryu (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Yamashita, Masakatsu (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Yamamoto, Shinya (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Yokoyama, Kioto (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Kani, Hisanori (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.)",,"Yoshimoto, Nobuyasu (Department of Breast Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Takayama, Satoru (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Sakamoto, Masaki (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Ishikawa, Ken (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Katada, Takeyasu (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Kawate, Akifumi (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Takura, Kohei (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Takayama, Shoryu (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Yamashita, Masakatsu (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Yamamoto, Shinya (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Yokoyama, Kioto (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.); Kani, Hisanori (Department of Surgery, Nagoya Tokushukai General Hospital, Kasugai, Japan.)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8962867,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142972927,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

While quantitative estimates on reduction in volume of screening tests or diagnostic evaluation are readily available from the high-income countries, very little data are available from the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). From the CanScreen5 global cancer screening data repository we identified six LMICs through purposive sampling based on the availability of cancer screening data at least for the years 2019 and 2020. These countries represented those in high human development index (HDI) categories (Argentina, Colombia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) and medium HDI categories (Bangladesh and Morocco). No data were available from low HDI countries to perform similar analysis. The reduction in the volume of tests in 2020 compared to the previous year ranged from 14.1% in Bangladesh to 72.9% in Argentina (regional programme) for cervical screening, from 14.2% in Bangladesh to 49.4% in Morocco for breast cancer screening and 30.7% in Thailand for colorectal cancer screening. Number of colposcopies was reduced in 2020 compared to previous year by 88.9% in Argentina, 38.2% in Colombia, 27.4% in Bangladesh, and 52.2% in Morocco. The reduction in detection rates of CIN 2 or worse lesions ranged from 20.7% in Morocco to 45.4% in Argentina. Reduction of breast cancer detection by 19.1% was reported from Morocco. No association of the impact of pandemic could be seen with HDI categories. Quantifying the impact of service disruptions in screening and diagnostic tests will allow the programmes to strategize how to ramp up services to clear the backlogs in screening and more crucially in further evaluation of screen positives. The data can be used to estimate the impact on stage distribution and avoidable mortality from these common cancers.",,No external funding was received for this work.,eLife,,"Eduardo L Franco, Eduardo L Franco",Female; Humans; Thailand; Early Detection of Cancer; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Pandemics; Bangladesh; Sri Lanka; Argentina; Colombia; Morocco; COVID-19; Developing Countries,2023-05-16,2023,2023-05-16,,12,,e86527,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lucas, Eric; Murillo, Raul; Arrossi, Silvina; Bárcena, Martin; Chami, Youssef; Nessa, Ashrafun; Perera, Suraj; Silva, Padmaka; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Muwonge, Richard; Basu, Partha","Lucas, Eric (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France); Murillo, Raul (Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogota, Colombia); Arrossi, Silvina (Investigadora CEDES/CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina); Bárcena, Martin (Instituto Provincial del Cáncer, Jujuy, Argentina); Chami, Youssef (Foundation Lalla Salma Cancer prevention and treatment, Rabat, Morocco); Nessa, Ashrafun (Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh); Perera, Suraj (Ministry of Health, Colombo, Sri Lanka); Silva, Padmaka (Ministry of Health, Colombo, Sri Lanka); Sangrajrang, Suleeporn (National Cancer Institute of Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand); Muwonge, Richard (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France); Basu, Partha (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France)","Basu, Partha (International Agency for Research on Cancer)","Lucas, Eric (International Agency for Research on Cancer); Murillo, Raul (Hospital Universitario San Ignacio); Arrossi, Silvina (Center for the Study of State and Society); Bárcena, Martin (Instituto Provincial del Cáncer, Jujuy, Argentina); Chami, Youssef (Foundation Lalla Salma Cancer prevention and treatment, Rabat, Morocco); Nessa, Ashrafun (Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University); Perera, Suraj (Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine); Silva, Padmaka (Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine); Sangrajrang, Suleeporn (National Cancer Institute of Thailand); Muwonge, Richard (International Agency for Research on Cancer); Basu, Partha (International Agency for Research on Cancer)",10,10,,,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.86527,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158078436,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

To date, no study has identified specific infection control methods. We aimed to provide practical methods for COVID-19 risk reduction during breast cancer screening mammography (MMG) by examining an overview of potential contamination routes of aerosols and possible risks for patients and health care providers.MethodsComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for airflow and aerosol dispersion in a 3D virtual model of a mobile MMG laboratory room. This model was constructed based on the actual mobile screening MMG bus ‘Cosmos’ in the Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion & Disease Prevention. Examiner and patient geometries were obtained by scanning an actual human using a 3D Scanner. Contamination of the room was evaluated by counting the numbers of suspended and deposited aerosols.ResultsWe applied the CFD simulation model to the exhalation of small or large aerosols from a patient and examiner in the MMG laboratory. Only 14.5% and 54.5% of large and small aerosols, respectively, were discharged out of the room with two doors open. In contrast, the proportion of large and small aerosols discharged out of the room increased to 96.6% and 97.9%, respectively, with the addition of forced gentle wind by the blower fan. This simulation was verified by a mist aerosol experiment conducted in the mobile MMG laboratory.ConclusionAdding forced ventilation to a MMG laboratory with two doors open may enable risk reduction dramatically. This could be applied to other clinical situations.","We thank Ms. Mika Watanabe, Ms. Yukie Yoshinaga, Ms. Miyuki Satake in Division of Diagnostic Imaging, Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Mr. Kosuke Yanagihara, Mr. Sho Ozawa in Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Academic English Consultation in Chiba University supported English editing for their kind cooperation.",,Breast Cancer,,,"Adult; Aerosols; COVID-19; Computer Simulation; Exhalation; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mammography; Occupational Exposure; Risk Assessment; SARS-CoV-2; Ventilation",2021-04-02,2021,2021-04-02,2021-07,28,4,969-976,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Takada, Mamoru; Tanaka, Gaku; Hashimoto, Hideyuki; Hirai, Yasuyuki; Fukushima, Taichi; Nagashima, Takeshi; Otsuka, Masayuki; Imazeki, Fumio","Takada, Mamoru (Safety and Health Organization, Chiba University, 1-33, Yayoi-cho, Inage-ku, Chiba-City, Chiba, Japan; Department of General Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan); Tanaka, Gaku (Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan); Hashimoto, Hideyuki (Breast Screening Center, Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Chiba, Japan); Hirai, Yasuyuki (Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan); Fukushima, Taichi (Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan); Nagashima, Takeshi (Department of General Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan); Otsuka, Masayuki (Department of General Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan); Imazeki, Fumio (Safety and Health Organization, Chiba University, 1-33, Yayoi-cho, Inage-ku, Chiba-City, Chiba, Japan)","Takada, Mamoru (Chiba University; Chiba University)","Takada, Mamoru (Chiba University; Chiba University); Tanaka, Gaku (Chiba University); Hashimoto, Hideyuki (Breast Screening Center, Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Chiba, Japan); Hirai, Yasuyuki (Chiba University); Fukushima, Taichi (Chiba University); Nagashima, Takeshi (Chiba University); Otsuka, Masayuki (Chiba University); Imazeki, Fumio (Chiba University)",3,1,0.07,0.92,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12282-021-01235-y,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136888104,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study analyzed how Brazilian breast specialists are managing EBC.MethodsAn electronic survey was conducted with members of the Brazilian Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (SBM) between April 30 and May 11, 2020. Bivariate analysis was used to describe changes in how specialists managed EBC at the beginning and during the pandemic, according to breast cancer subtype and oncoplastic surgery.ResultsThe response rate was 34.4% (503/1462 specialists). Most of the respondents (324; 64.4%) lived in a state capital city, were board-certified as breast specialists (395; 78.5%) and either worked in an academic institute or one associated with breast cancer treatment (390; 77.5%). The best response rate was from the southeast of the country (240; 47.7%) followed by the northeast (128; 25.4%). At the beginning of the pandemic, 43% changed their management approach. As the outbreak progressed, this proportion increased to 69.8% (p < 0.001). The southeast of the country (p = 0.005) and the state capital cities (p < 0.001) were associated with changes at the beginning of the pandemic, while being female (p = 0.001) was associated with changes during the pandemic. For hormone receptor-positive tumors with the best prognosis (Ki-67 < 20%), 47.9% and 17.7% of specialists would recommend neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal and premenopausal women, respectively. For tumors with poorer prognosis (Ki-67 > 30%), 34% and 10.9% would recommend it for postmenopausal and premenopausal women, respectively. Menopausal status significantly affected whether the specialists changed their approach (p < 0.00001). For tumors ≥ 1.0 cm, 42.9% of respondents would recommend neoadjuvant systemic therapy for triple-negative tumors and 39.6% for HER2 + tumors. Overall, 63.4% would recommend immediate total breast reconstruction, while only 3.4% would recommend autologous reconstruction. In breast-conserving surgery, 75% would recommend partial breast reconstruction; however, 54.1% would contraindicate mammoplasty. Furthermore, 84.9% of respondents would not recommend prophylactic mastectomy in cases of BRCA mutation.ConclusionsImportant changes occurred in EBC treatment, particularly for hormone receptor-positive tumors, as the outbreak progressed in each region. Systematic monitoring could assure appropriate breast cancer treatment, mitigating the impact of the pandemic.",The authors are grateful to Fernanda Pereira Alves and Jéssica Telles Bonavita for their secretary work in providing the relevant data on the SBM members.,,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,,,"Adult; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Betacoronavirus; Brazil; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Disease Management; Female; Genes, BRCA1; Genes, BRCA2; Humans; Mammaplasty; Mastectomy; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Pandemics; Patient Selection; Pneumonia, Viral; Postmenopause; Premenopause; Prophylactic Mastectomy; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Progesterone; SARS-CoV-2; Societies, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tumor Burden",2020-08-16,2020,2020-08-16,2020-11,184,2,637-647,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Cavalcante, Francisco Pimentel; Novita, Guilherme Garcia; Millen, Eduardo Camargo; Zerwes, Felipe Pereira; de Oliveira, Vilmar Marques; Sousa, Ana Luiza Lima; Freitas Junior, Ruffo","Cavalcante, Francisco Pimentel (Fortaleza General Hospital (HGF), Rua Ávila Goularte, 900, 60150-160, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil); Novita, Guilherme Garcia (Grupo Américas, São Paulo, SP, Brazil); Millen, Eduardo Camargo (São Vicente Clinic, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil); Zerwes, Felipe Pereira (Pontificia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); de Oliveira, Vilmar Marques (Santa Casa de São Paulo, School of Medical Sciences, São Paulo, SP, Brazil); Sousa, Ana Luiza Lima (Federal University of Goiás, Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil); Freitas Junior, Ruffo (Advanced Center for Diagnosis and Treatment for Breast Cancer (CORA), Federal University of Goiás, Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil)","Cavalcante, Francisco Pimentel (Hospital Geral de Fortaleza)","Cavalcante, Francisco Pimentel (Hospital Geral de Fortaleza); Novita, Guilherme Garcia (Grupo Américas, São Paulo, SP, Brazil); Millen, Eduardo Camargo (São Vicente Clinic, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil); Zerwes, Felipe Pereira (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul); de Oliveira, Vilmar Marques (Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Santa Casa de São Paulo); Sousa, Ana Luiza Lima (Universidade Federal de Goiás); Freitas Junior, Ruffo (Universidade Federal de Goiás)",23,10,1.31,5.6,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10549-020-05877-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130144588,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was officially declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, and with no effective treatment available, preventing spread has been paramount. Previously, all referrals from primary care were seen in the rapid-access breast clinic (RABC). Clinic appointments exposed patients and healthcare professionals to risk.
METHOD: Initial triage during the lockdown was in line with national governing body guidance, rejected low risk referrals and streamed remaining patients through a telephone consultation to RABC or discharge. A modified triage pathway streamed all patients through virtual triage to RABC, telephone clinic or discharge with advice and guidance categories. Demographics, reasons for referral and outcomes data were collected and presented as median with range and frequency with percentages.
RESULTS: Initial triage (23 March-23 April 2020) found fewer referrals with a higher percentage of breast cancer diagnoses. Modified triage (22 June-17 July 2020) resulted in a 35.1% (99/282) reduction in RABC attendance. Overall cancer detection rate remained similar at 4.2% of all referrals pre-COVID (18/429) and 4.3% (12/282) during modified triage. After six months follow-up of patients not seen in RABC during the modified triage pathway, 18 patients were re-referred to RABC and none were diagnosed with cancer.
CONCLUSION: A modified triage pathway has the potential to improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further refinement of pathway is feasible in collaboration with primary care.",,,Annals of The Royal College of Surgeons of England,,,Adult; Breast Diseases; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Referral and Consultation; Retrospective Studies; Triage; United Kingdom,2021-09,2021,,2021-09,103,8,576-582,All OA; Green,Article,"Shetty, G; Datta, U; Rea, I; Rai, S; Hwang, M-J; Hoar, F; Sintler, M; Mirza, M; Husain, A; Tan, M","Shetty, G (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.; Kasturba Medical College Mangalore & Manipal Academy of Health Education, Manipal, India.); Datta, U (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Rea, I (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Rai, S (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Hwang, M-J (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.; North West Wales NHS Trust, UK.); Hoar, F (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Sintler, M (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Mirza, M (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Husain, A (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Tan, M (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.)","Shetty, G (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.; Kasturba Medical College, Manipal)","Shetty, G (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.; Kasturba Medical College, Manipal); Datta, U (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Rea, I (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Rai, S (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Hwang, M-J (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.; Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board); Hoar, F (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Sintler, M (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Mirza, M (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Husain, A (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.); Tan, M (Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.)",4,3,0.23,1.22,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10335053,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140771205,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers. Where concrete data could not be found, peer-reviewed expert opinion is provided.
RESULTS: There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy. Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes. If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy. The use of shorter brachytherapy fractionation schedules will help minimize patient exposure and conserve resources.
CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some. Reduced patient exposure and resource utilization is important during COVID-19. Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients. Physicians should continue to follow developing institutional, state, and federal guidelines/recommendations as challenges in delivering care during COVID-19 will continue to evolve.",,"Disclosures: The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Our aim was to evaluate an impact of COVID-19 pandemic management measures on cancer services at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Lithuania. We assessed the time period from 1 February 2020 to 31 December 2020 and compared it to the same period of 2019. Data for our analysis were extracted from the NCI Hospital Information System (HIS) and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). Contingency table analysis and ANOVA were performed. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the cancer services provided by NCI. Reductions in diagnostic radiology (-16%) and endoscopy (-29%) procedures were accompanied by a decreased number of patients with ongoing medical (-30%), radiation (-6%) or surgical (-10%) treatment. The changes in the number of newly diagnosed cancer patients were dependent on tumor type and disease stage, showing a rise in advanced disease at diagnosis already during the early period of the first lockdown. The extent of out-patient consultations (-14%) and disease follow-up visits (-16%) was also affected by the pandemic, and only referrals to psychological/psychiatric counselling were increased. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the structure of cancer services by fostering the application of modified systemic anticancer therapy or hypofractionated radiotherapy. The most dramatic drop occurred in the number of patients participating in cancer prevention programs; the loss was 25% for colon cancer and 62% for breast cancer screening. Marked restriction in access to preventive cancer screening and overall reduction of the whole spectrum of cancer services may negatively affect cancer survival measures in the nearest future.",,This project was funded by the European Union (project No P-DNR-21-37) under the agreement with the Research Council of Lithuania.,Healthcare,,,,2021-11-09,2021,2021-11-09,,9,11,1522,All OA;

The complexity of this scenario has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic which dramatically affected the continuity of the provision of optimal care to chronic patients. Telemedicine can support the management of oncology care paths by furnishing a suite of effective and efficient tools to monitor the therapies of cancer patients. In particular, this is a suitable setting for therapies that are administered at home. In this paper, we present an AI-based system, called Arianna, designed and implemented to support and monitor patients treated by the professionals belonging to the Breast Cancer Unit Network (BCU-Net) along the entire clinical path of breast cancer treatment. We describe in this work the three modules composing the Arianna system (the tools for patients and clinicians, and the symbolic AI-based module). The system has been validated in a qualitative way and we demonstrated how the Arianna solution reached a high level of acceptability by all types of end-users by making it suitable for a concrete integration into the daily practice of the BCU-Net.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,,,Humans; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Pandemics; COVID-19; Artificial Intelligence; Patient Care Planning,2023-02-23,2023,2023-02-23,2023-04,138,,102514,Closed,Article,"Dragoni, Mauro; Eccher, Claudio; Ferro, Antonella; Bailoni, Tania; Maimone, Rosa; Zorzi, Andrea; Bacchiega, Alessandro; Stulzer, Gabriele; Ghidini, Chiara","Dragoni, Mauro (Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.

Interviews in this sub-study used a mix-methods approach to explore understanding of the pathway, confidence in self-management, triggers to seek help and/or re-engage with the clinical breast team and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to pre-assigned categories were summarised as counts/ percentages and collated in tabular or graphic format. Free responses were recorded verbatim and reviewed using framework analysis.ResultsParticipants regarded the SSM/PIFU pathway as a way to save time and money for them and the National Health Service (NHS) (14/32; 44%) and as a means of assuming responsibility for their own follow-up (18/32; 56%). Most maintained (very/somewhat) confidence in managing their BC follow-up care (baseline 31/32, 97%; 12 months 29/31, 93%). During the year, 19% (5/26) stopped endocrine therapy altogether because of side effects. Qualitative analysis revealed general satisfaction with SSM/PIFU and described the breast care nurses as reassuring and empathic. However, there was a lingering anxiety about identifying signs and symptoms correctly, particularly for those with screen-detected cancers. There was also uncertainty about who to contact for psychological support. The COVID-19 pandemic discouraged some participants from contacting the helpline as they did not want to overburden the NHS.ConclusionsThe results show that during the first year on the SSM/PIFU pathway, most patients felt confident managing their own care. Clinical teams should benefit from understanding patients’ expectations and experiences and potentially modify the service for men with BC and/or those with screen-detected breast cancers.",Grateful thanks to all participants for engaging with the PRAGMATIC study and to the clinical teams for their support.,This work was supported by a grant from Surrey and Sussex Cancer Alliance (19/20 Transformation Funding).,Supportive Care in Cancer,,,Male; Humans; Breast Neoplasms; Self-Management; Follow-Up Studies; Pandemics; State Medicine; COVID-19,2023-10-27,2023,2023-10-27,2023-11,31,11,658,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Jenkins, Valerie; Starkings, Rachel; Teoh, May; May, Shirley; Bloomfield, David; Zammit, Charles; Elwell-Sutton, Debbie; Betal, Dibendu; Finlay, Judith; Nicholson, Kay; Kothari, Manish; Santos, Regina; Stewart, Elaine; Bell, Stephanie; McKinna, Fiona; Matthews, Lucy","Jenkins, Valerie (Sussex Health Outcomes Research & Education in Cancer (SHORE-C), Brighton & Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, East Sussex, England, UK); Starkings, Rachel (Sussex Health Outcomes Research & Education in Cancer (SHORE-C), Brighton & Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, East Sussex, England, UK); Teoh, May (Ashford & St Peter’s NHS Foundation Trust, London Road, Ashford, Surrey, England, UK); May, Shirley (Sussex Health Outcomes Research & Education in Cancer (SHORE-C), Brighton & Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, East Sussex, England, UK); Bloomfield, David (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton, East Sussex, England, UK); Zammit, Charles (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton, East Sussex, England, UK); Elwell-Sutton, Debbie (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton, East Sussex, England, UK); Betal, Dibendu (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Worthing, West Sussex, England, UK); Finlay, Judith (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Worthing, West Sussex, England, UK); Nicholson, Kay (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Worthing, West Sussex, England, UK); Kothari, Manish (Ashford & St Peter’s NHS Foundation Trust, London Road, Ashford, Surrey, England, UK); Santos, Regina (Ashford & St Peter’s NHS Foundation Trust, London Road, Ashford, Surrey, England, UK); Stewart, Elaine (Ashford & St Peter’s NHS Foundation Trust, London Road, Ashford, Surrey, England, UK); Bell, Stephanie (Surrey & Sussex Cancer Alliance, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, Surrey, England, UK); McKinna, Fiona (Surrey & Sussex Cancer Alliance, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, Surrey, England, UK); Matthews, Lucy (Sussex Health Outcomes Research & Education in Cancer (SHORE-C), Brighton & Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, East Sussex, England, UK)","Jenkins, Valerie (Brighton and Sussex Medical School)","Jenkins, Valerie (Brighton and Sussex Medical School); Starkings, Rachel (Brighton and Sussex Medical School); Teoh, May (National Health Service England); May, Shirley (Brighton and Sussex Medical School); Bloomfield, David (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust); Zammit, Charles (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust); Elwell-Sutton, Debbie (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust); Betal, Dibendu (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust); Finlay, Judith (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust); Nicholson, Kay (University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust); Kothari, Manish (National Health Service England); Santos, Regina (National Health Service England); Stewart, Elaine (National Health Service England); Bell, Stephanie (Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust); McKinna, Fiona (Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust); Matthews, Lucy (Brighton and Sussex Medical School)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00520-023-08115-5.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165267784,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

We sought to evaluate how medical facilities prioritized breast imaging services during periods of reduced capacity or upon re-opening after closures. In fall 2020, we surveyed 77 breast imaging facilities within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium in the United States. The survey ascertained the pandemic's impact on clinical practices during March-September 2020. Nearly all facilities (97%) reported closing or operating at reduced capacity at some point during this period. All facilities were open by August 2020, though 14% were still operating at reduced capacity in September 2020. During periods of re-opening or reduced capacity, 93% of facilities reported prioritizing diagnostic breast imaging over breast cancer screening. For diagnostic imaging, facilities prioritized based on rescheduling canceled appointments (89%), specific indication for diagnostic imaging (89%), patient demand (84%), individual characteristics and risk factors (77%), and time since last imaging examination (72%). For screening mammography, facilities prioritized based on rescheduled cancelations (96%), patient demand (83%), individual characteristics and risk factors (73%), and time since last mammogram (71%). For biopsy services, more than 90% of facilities reported prioritization based on rescheduling of canceled exams, patient demand, patient characteristics and risk factors and level of suspicion on imaging. The observed patterns from this large and geographically diverse sample of facilities in the United States indicate that multiple factors were commonly used to prioritize breast imaging services during periods of reduced capacity.",,This work was supported by award PCS-1504-30370 from the 10.13039/100006093Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and grant R01CA248068 from the 10.13039/100000054National Cancer Institute.

Physician well-being was measured using 6 COVID-19 burnout emotions and the 4-item PROMIS short form for anxiety and sleep disturbance. We examined associations between treatment delays and physician well-being, adjusting for demographic factors, COVID-19 testing and ten COVID-19 pandemic concerns.Results870 physicians completed the survey, 61% were surgeons. The mean age of physicians was 52 and 548 (63.9%) were female. 669 (79.4%) reported some delay in patient care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 384 (44.1%) and 529 (60.8%) of physicians scored outside normal limits for anxiety and sleep disturbance, respectively. After adjusting for demographic factors and COVID-19 testing, mean anxiety and COVID-19 burnout scores were significantly higher among physicians whose patients experienced either delays in surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, breast imaging or specialty consultation. A multivariable model adjusting for ten physician COVID-19 concerns and delays showed that “delays will impact my emotional well-being” was the strongest concern associated with anxiety, sleep disturbance and COVID-19 burnout factors.ConclusionsBreast cancer treatment delays during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States were associated with a negative impact on physician emotional wellness.",,There was no funding source for this study.,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,,,"Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oncologists; Sleep; Surgeons; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time-to-Treatment; United States",2021-01-31,2021,2021-01-31,2021-04,186,3,625-635,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Yao, Katharine A.; Attai, Deanna; Bleicher, Richard; Kuchta, Kristine; Moran, Meena; Boughey, Judy; Wilke, Lee G.; Dietz, Jill R.; Stevens, Randy; Pesce, Catherine; Kopkash, Katherine; Kurtzman, Scott; Sarantou, Terry; Victorson, David","Yao, Katharine A.

To help prepare health services, the Australian Government Department of Health commissioned a modelled evaluation of the impact of disruptions to population breast, bowel, and cervical cancer screening programmes on cancer outcomes and cancer services. We used the Policy1 modelling platforms to predict outcomes for potential disruptions to cancer screening participation, covering periods of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo. We estimated missed screens, clinical outcomes (cancer incidence, tumour staging), and various diagnostic service impacts. We found that a 12-mo screening disruption would reduce breast cancer diagnoses (9.3% population-level reduction over 2020-2021) and colorectal cancer (up to 12.1% reduction over 2020-21), and increase cervical cancer diagnoses (up to 3.6% over 2020-2022), with upstaging expected for these cancer types (2, 1.4, and 6.8% for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, respectively). Findings for 6-12-mo disruption scenarios illustrate that maintaining screening participation is critical to preventing an increase in the burden of cancer at a population level. We provide programme-specific insights into which outcomes are expected to change, when changes are likely to become apparent, and likely downstream impacts.

In this review, we summarize how COVID-19 has thus far impacted the management of TNBC and highlighted where more information is needed to hone shifting guidelines. Due to the immunocompromised state of most TNBC patients receiving treatment, TNBC management during the pandemic presents challenges beyond the constraints of overburdened healthcare systems. We conducted a literature search of treatment recommendations for both primary and targeted TNBC therapeutic strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak and noted changes to treatment timing and drugs of choice. Further, given that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, which has systemic consequences, management of TNBC patients with metastatic versus localized disease has additional considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Published dataset gene expression analysis of critical SARS-CoV-2 cell entry proteins in TNBCs suggests that the virus could in theory infect metastasized TNBC cells it contacts. This may have unforeseen consequences in terms of both the dynamics of the resulting acute viral infection and the progression of the chronic metastatic disease. Undoubtedly, the results thus far suggest that more research is required to attain a full understanding of the direct and indirect clinical impacts of COVID-19 on TNBC patients.","The results presented in Figure 1 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in breast cancer is comparable to cell lines permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and Figure 2 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in metastatic cancers were derived in part from data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network. https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.

Although the regulation of immune response is thought to play an important role in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), physicians often have difficulties in selecting the most appropriate treatment. Furthermore, the impact that interrupting breast cancer treatment due to a COVID-19 infection has on patient outcomes is still unknown. Herein we report a case of advanced breast cancer in a patient whose COVID-19 acute respiratory failure was successfully treated with minimal interruption to their anticancer therapy for recurrent breast cancer.Case presentationA 48-year-old woman developed carcinomatous pleurisy after curative surgery for breast cancer. One month after the initiation of targeted therapy with palbociclib and fulvestrant, the pleural effusion decreased, but soon after she developed a COVID-19 infection. Dexamethasone (8 mg/day) was administered due to a prolonged fever, but her respiratory symptoms got worse and pneumonia appeared on a computed tomography (CT) scan 7 days after hospitalization. Thus, steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day) was administered for 3 days. Her respiratory condition rapidly improved. Two weeks after hospital discharge, complete regression of pneumonia was confirmed on CT scan, and her targeted therapy was resumed at the same dose and strength. More than 6 months later, her metastatic disease remains stable while on the same treatment. Retrospective analysis of the patient's neutralizing antibodies found the neutralizing activity was low in the early stages of infection, but became high after recovery. This suggests the patient acquired an immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through the infection, despite having a mild myelosuppression due to treatment for recurrent breast cancer.ConclusionsSteroid pulse therapy is available worldwide, and may have an important role in cancer patients who develop severe pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2, by enabling them to avoid any long-term disruption to anticancer therapy. Moreover, it might also be useful when antiviral therapies lose their efficacy due to mutations of the virus, such as the Omicron variant. A critical element in cases such as this one is that treatment decisions are made by a team of specialists, including pulmonologists.","The authors thank the Department of Research Support Utilizing Bioresource Bank, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, for use of their facilities.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the pandemic within the Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) by comparing total volumes of screening mammographic examinations and volumes of screening mammographic examinations with abnormal results before and during the pandemic, and to assess backlogs on the basis of adherence to the prioritization framework.
METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted among women aged 50 to 74 years at average risk and women aged 30 to 69 years at high risk, who participated in the OBSP. Percentage change was calculated by comparing observed monthly volumes of mammographic examinations from March 2020 to March 2021 with 2019 volumes and proportions by risk group. We plotted estimates of backlog volumes of mammographic examinations by risk group, comparing pandemic with prepandemic screening practices. Volumes of mammographic examinations with abnormal results were plotted by risk group.
RESULTS: Volumes of mammographic examinations in the OBSP showed the largest declines in April and May 2020 (> 99% decrease) and returned to prepandemic levels as of March 2021, with an accumulated backlog of 340 876 examinations. As of March 2021, prioritization had reduced the backlog volumes of screens for participants at high risk for breast cancer by 96.5% (186 v. 5469 expected) and annual rescreens for participants at average risk for breast cancer by 13.5% (62 432 v. 72 202 expected); there was a minimal decline for initial screens. Conversely, the backlog increased by 7.6% for biennial rescreens (221 674 v. 206 079 expected). More than half (59.4%) of mammographic examinations with abnormal results were for participants in the higher risk groups.
INTERPRETATION: Prioritizing screening for those at higher risk for breast cancer may increase diagnostic yield and redirect resources to minimize potential long-term harms caused by the pandemic. This further supports the clinical utility of risk-stratified cancer screening.",This study was conducted with the support of Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) through in-kind contributions.,,CMAJ Open,,,Aged; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Guideline Adherence; Health Priorities; Humans; Mammography; Middle Aged; Ontario; Risk Factors,2021-10,2021,2021-12-21,2021-10,9,4,e1205-e1212,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chiarelli, Anna M; Walker, Meghan J; Espino-Hernandez, Gabriela; Gray, Natasha; Salleh, Ayesha; Adhihetty, Chamila; Gao, Julia; Fienberg, Samantha; Rey, Michelle A; Rabeneck, Linda","Chiarelli, Anna M (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont. anna.chiarelli@ontariohealth.ca.); Walker, Meghan J (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Espino-Hernandez, Gabriela (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Gray, Natasha (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Salleh, Ayesha (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Adhihetty, Chamila (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Gao, Julia (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Fienberg, Samantha (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Rey, Michelle A (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.); Rabeneck, Linda (Cancer Care Ontario (Chiarelli, Walker, Espino-Hernandez, Gray, Salleh, Adhihetty, Gao, Fienberg, Rey, Rabeneck), Ontario Health, Toronto, Ont.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health (Chiarelli, Walker, Rabeneck), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.; Department of Radiology (Fienberg), Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ont.)","Chiarelli, Anna M (University of Toronto)","Chiarelli, Anna M (University of Toronto); Walker, Meghan J (University of Toronto); Espino-Hernandez, Gabriela (University of Toronto); Gray, Natasha (University of Toronto); Salleh, Ayesha (University of Toronto); Adhihetty, Chamila (University of Toronto); Gao, Julia (University of Toronto); Fienberg, Samantha (University of Toronto); Rey, Michelle A (University of Toronto); Rabeneck, Linda (University of Toronto)",11,8,1.32,4.51,https://www.cmajopen.ca/content/cmajo/9/4/E1205.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144054113,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

This monocentric retrospective analysis has compared the pre-Covid period (March 2019 to March 2020) to the Covid period (April 2020 to April 2021) in terms of screening programs, clinical, surgical and pathological. A total of 799 patients diagnosed with Breast Cancer (BC) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC) underwent surgery during the two periods. In FVG in 2020 a decrease in mammography screening of 17.1% has been registered compared to 2019; this reduction has been higher for CRC screening, which summed up to 24.5%. As far as BC is concerned, screening-detected tumours rose significantly from 18 to 28%, mastectomies decreased from 40 to 31% and advanced tumours treated surgically decreased from 12 to 6%. Concerning CRC, a significant increase in admissions through the Emergency Department has been registered in spite of a stable percentage of urgent surgery performed, proving that severely symptomatic patients have been treated adequately. Open surgery has significantly decreased, whereas the tumoral stage and complications have remained constant in the two periods. This study has proved that maintaining standards of care and validated protocols during emergency is the most adequate and winning strategy: impact on BC and CRC has been less important than expected. These results support the recommendations for immediate and rapid screening program resumption at operating speed, using prioritization strategies to make up for the diagnostic delays.","The authors thank all the General Surgery Unit Residents, Nurses, Surgeons and the entire staff for their cooperation.",No funds were obtained for this paper.

METHODS: We used the TriNetX platform to analyze 20 health care institutions that have relevant, up-to-date encounter data. Using this COVID and Cancer Research Network (CCRN), we compared cancer cohorts identified by querying encounter data pre-COVID (January 2019-April 2019) and current (January 2020-April 2020). Cohorts were generated for all patients with neoplasms (malignant, benign, in situ, and of unspecified behavior), with new incidence neoplasms (first encounter), with exclusively malignant neoplasms, and with new incidence malignant neoplasms. Data from a UK institution were similarly analyzed. Additional analyses were performed on patients with selected cancers, as well as on those having had cancer screening.
RESULTS: Clear trends were identified that suggest a significant decline in all current cohorts explored, with April 2020 displaying the largest decrease in the number of patients with cancer having encounters. Of the cancer types analyzed, lung, colorectal, and hematologic cancer cohorts exhibited smaller decreases in size in April 2020 versus 2019 (-39.1%, -39.9%, -39.1%, respectively) compared with cohort size decreases for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma (-47.7%, -49.1%, -51.8%, respectively). In addition, cancer screenings declined drastically, with breast cancer screenings dropping by -89.2% and colorectal cancer screenings by -84.5%.
CONCLUSION: Trends seen in the CCRN clearly suggest a significant decrease in all cancer-related patient encounters as a result of the pandemic. The steep decreases in cancer screening and patients with a new incidence of cancer suggest the possibility of a future increase in patients with later-stage cancer being seen initially as well as an increased demand for cancer screening procedures as delayed tests are rescheduled.",,,JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics,,,"COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United Kingdom; United States",2020-11,2020,,2020-11,4,4,657-665,All OA; Green,Article,"London, Jack W; Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara; Palchuk, Matvey B; Sankey, Peter; McNair, Christopher","London, Jack W (Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.); Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara (TriNetX, Cambridge, MA.); Palchuk, Matvey B (TriNetX, Cambridge, MA.); Sankey, Peter (University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, Plymouth, United Kingdom.); McNair, Christopher (Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.)",,"London, Jack W (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center); Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara (TriNetX (United States)); Palchuk, Matvey B (TriNetX (United States)); Sankey, Peter (University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust); McNair, Christopher (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center)",256,83,12.61,71.12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444638,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129695377,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

In those places where the pandemic has had the greatest effect, it is of paramount importance for most patients to be at home, reducing or postponing their attendance at clinics, as well as avoiding surgeries. In this scenario, neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal-like tumours) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries.

The impact of the pandemic may have exacerbated existing disparities in cancer screening due to the disproportionate burden of illness and job loss among racial/ ethnic minorities, and potentially, uneven resumption of care between different racial/ ethnic groups. Using electronic health record data from Mass General Brigham (MGB), we assessed changes in rates of breast, cervical, colorectal and lung cancer screening before and during the pandemic. Among patients who received primary care in an MGB-affiliated primary care practice, cancer screening rates were calculated as the number of individuals who received a screening test for each cancer type over the number of individuals due for each test, during each month between April 2019-November 2020. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to test for changes in screening rates by race/ethnicity before and during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, relative to White individuals, Asian women were less likely to receive breast cancer screening (p < 0.001), and Latinx and Black individuals were less likely to screen for lung cancer (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02). Our results did not show significant improvement or worsening of racial/ethnic disparities for any cancer screening type as screening resumed. However, as of November 2020 rates of screening for breast cancer were lower than pre-pandemic levels for Latinx individuals, and lung cancer screening rates were higher than baseline for Latinx, Black or White individuals. Further monitoring of disparities in cancer screening is warranted as the pandemic evolves.","This study was conducted as part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded consortium, METRICS (Multi-level Optimization of the Cervical Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings Populations; Grant number 1UM1CA221940).",,Preventive Medicine,,,COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Ethnicity; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United States,2021-06-30,2021,2021-06-30,2021-10,151,,106640,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Marcondes, Felippe O; Cheng, David; Warner, Erica T; Kamran, Sophia C; Haas, Jennifer S","Marcondes, Felippe O (Division of General Internal Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States; Mongan Institute, Clinical Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.); Cheng, David (Division of Biostatistics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.); Warner, Erica T (Mongan Institute, Clinical Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.); Kamran, Sophia C (Department of Radiation Oncology, Mass General Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.); Haas, Jennifer S (Division of General Internal Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States; Mongan Institute, Clinical Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that included women submitted to breast exams and procedures in a private hospital in São Paulo, SP, Brazil, as from the period of most strict social isolation measures, in 2020 (separated in first period of social isolation, March 24 to June 21, 2020, and second period, June 22 to December 31, 2020), as compared to the same period in 2019. The number of exams, cancer detection rates, pathologic findings and risk factors were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 32,144 patients were included in the study. Breast imaging exams and procedures decreased by 78.9% in the first period, and 2.7% in the second period, in 2020. By the end of 2020, the number of breast cancer lesions detected was just six cases less than in 2019, although the number of patients submitted to mammograms was 35% lower.
CONCLUSION: There was a drop in number of breast exams and cancer diagnoses in the first 90 days of the pandemic. The decrease in diagnosis of cancer was partially compensated in the second period, but the number of patients submitted to mammograms by the end of 2020 was lower, still considering a large number of patients with delayed exams.",,,Einstein (São Paulo),,,Brazil; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2,2021-12-20,2021,2021-12-20,2021,19,,eao6721,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tachibana, Bruna Mayumi Takaki; de Moura Ribeiro, Renato Leme; Federicci, Érica Elisangela Françolin; Feres, Renata; Lupinacci, Felipe Antonio Sulla; Yonekura, Iviny; Racy, Ana Claudia Silveira","Tachibana, Bruna Mayumi Takaki (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.); de Moura Ribeiro, Renato Leme (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Federicci, Érica Elisangela Françolin (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Feres, Renata (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Lupinacci, Felipe Antonio Sulla (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Yonekura, Iviny (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Racy, Ana Claudia Silveira (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.)",,"Tachibana, Bruna Mayumi Takaki (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein); de Moura Ribeiro, Renato Leme (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein); Federicci, Érica Elisangela Françolin (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein); Feres, Renata (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein); Lupinacci, Felipe Antonio Sulla (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein); Yonekura, Iviny (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein); Racy, Ana Claudia Silveira (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein)",19,14,1.81,6.71,https://journal.einstein.br/wp-content/uploads/articles_xml/2317-6385-eins-19-eAO6721/2317-6385-eins-19-eAO6721.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143991021,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Methods: This longitudinal cohort study compared the changes in chronic care quality measures among patients with and without telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to patients in the previous years and by patient sociodemographic subgroup. Participants were Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 65 years or older from an Accountable Care Organization in the Midwest United States. Three utilization-based measures included having 2+ A1C tests, breast cancer screening, and depression screening. Three outcome-based measures included A1C control, blood pressure control, and depression diagnosis. Results: During the study period, the pandemic cohort experienced 5-17 percentage points' decrease in utilization-based measures (e.g., 2+ A1C tests 63.9% vs. 51.1%; OR [95% confidence intervals] = 0.35 [0.34-0.36]) from baseline relative to the control cohort. The outcome-based measures also significantly decreased but at smaller magnitudes (3-5 percentage points). About 51.5% patients had at least one telehealth visit. The utilization-based measures for these patients were significantly higher than those without any telehealth visit (e.g., 2+ A1C 57.1% vs. 51.1%, p < 0.01). However, the outcome-based measures were comparable. Patients from historically underserved groups had a larger decline in health care outcomes than their counterparts. Among patient with at least one telehealth visit, these disparities were no longer significant. Discussions: Telehealth was associated with less negative impact of the pandemic and better performance in chronic care management, but more for utilization-based measures and less for outcome-based measures. Telehealth was also associated with less disparities in care outcomes.",,This study is supported by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (HSD-1603-35039) and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (AAI2989).,Telemedicine Journal and e-Health,,,"Humans; Telemedicine; Aged; Female; COVID-19; Male; United States; Longitudinal Studies; Chronic Disease; Medicare; Healthcare Disparities; SARS-CoV-2; Aged, 80 and over; Pandemics; Midwestern United States",2024-05-03,2024,2024-05-03,2024-08-01,30,8,e2287-e2299,Closed,Article,"Cao, Ying; Chen, Dandi; Smith, Maureen","Cao, Ying (Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.); Chen, Dandi (Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.); Smith, Maureen (Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, and University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Health Innovation Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.)","Cao, Ying (University of Wisconsin–Madison)","Cao, Ying (University of Wisconsin–Madison); Chen, Dandi (University of Wisconsin–Madison); Smith, Maureen (University of Wisconsin–Madison; University of Wisconsin–Madison; University of Wisconsin–Madison)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171683692,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Purpose To examine breast biopsy recommendations and breast cancers diagnosed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic by mode of detection (screen detected vs symptomatic) and women's characteristics. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of prospectively collected data, monthly breast biopsy recommendations after mammography, US, or both with subsequent biopsy performed were examined from 66 facilities of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium between January 2019 and September 2020. The number of monthly and cumulative biopsies recommended and performed and the number of subsequent cancers diagnosed during the pandemic period (March 2020 to September 2020) were compared with data from the prepandemic period using Wald χ2 tests. Analyses were stratified by mode of detection and race or ethnicity. Results From January 2019 to September 2020, 17 728 biopsies were recommended and performed, with 6009 cancers diagnosed. From March to September 2020, there were substantially fewer breast biopsy recommendations with cancer diagnoses when compared with the same period in 2019 (1650 recommendations in 2020 vs 2171 recommendations in 2019 [24% fewer], P < .001), predominantly due to fewer screen-detected cancers (722 cancers in 2020 vs 1169 cancers in 2019 [38% fewer], P < .001) versus symptomatic cancers (895 cancers in 2020 vs 965 cancers in 2019 [7% fewer], P = .27). The decrease in cancer diagnoses was largest in Asian (67 diagnoses in 2020 vs 142 diagnoses in 2019 [53% fewer], P = .06) and Hispanic (82 diagnoses in 2020 vs 145 diagnoses in 2019 [43% fewer], P = .13) women, followed by Black women (210 diagnoses in 2020 vs 287 diagnoses in 2019 [27% fewer], P = .21). The decrease was smallest in non-Hispanic White women (1128 diagnoses in 2020 vs 1357 diagnoses in 2019 [17% fewer], P = .09). Conclusion There were substantially fewer breast biopsies with cancer diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic from March to September 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, with Asian and Hispanic women experiencing the largest declines, followed by Black women. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

METHODS: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (2019-2021) at the New York Presbyterian (NYP) Hospital Network were analyzed. Chi-square and student's t-test compared characteristics of patients presenting before and after the screening hiatus.
RESULTS: A total of 2137 patients were analyzed. Frequency of screen-detected and early-stage breast cancer declined post-hiatus (59.7%), but returned to baseline (69.3%). Frequency of screen-detected breast cancer was lowest for African American (AA) (57.5%) and Medicaid patients pre-hiatus (57.2%), and this disparity was reduced post-hiatus (65.3% for AA and 63.2% for Medicaid).
CONCLUSIONS: The return to baseline levels of screen-detected cancer, particularly among AA and Medicaid patients suggest that large-scale breast health education campaigns may be effective in resuming screening practices and in mitigating disparities.","Declaration of competing interest Dr. Vivian Bea receives grants from the American Cancer Society and Pfizer.

Screening mammography facilities closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. Recovery of screening volumes has varied across patient subgroups and facilities. OBJECTIVE. We compared screening mammography volumes and patient and facility characteristics between periods before COVID-19 and early and later postclosure recovery periods. METHODS. This retrospective study included screening mammograms performed in the same 2-month period (May 26-July 26) in 2019 (pre-COVID-19), 2020 (early recovery), and 2021 (late recovery after targeted interventions to expand access) and across multiple facility types (urban, suburban, community health center). Suburban sites had highest proportion of White patients and the greatest scheduling flexibility and expanded appointments during initial reopening. Findings were compared across years. RESULTS. For White patients, volumes decreased 36.6% from 6550 in 2019 (4384 in 2020) and then increased 61.0% to 6579 in 2021; for patients with races other than White, volumes decreased 53.9% from 1321 in 2019 (609 in 2020) and then increased 136.8% to 1442 in 2021. The percentage of mammograms in patients with races other than White was 16.8% in 2019, 12.2% in 2020, and 18.0% in 2021. The proportion performed at the urban center was 55.3% in 2019, 42.2% in 2020, and 45.9% in 2021; the proportion at suburban sites was 34.0% in 2019, 49.2% in 2020, and 43.5% in 2021. Pre-COVID-19 volumes were reached by the sixth week after reopening for suburban sites but were not reached during early recovery for the other sites. The proportion that were performed on Saturday for suburban sites was similar across periods, whereas the proportion performed on Saturday for the urban site was 7.6% in 2019, 5.3% in 2020, and 8.8% in 2021; the community health center did not offer Saturday appointments during recovery. CONCLUSION. After reopening, screening shifted from urban to suburban settings, with a disproportionate screening decrease in patients with races other than White. Initial delayed access at facilities serving underserved populations exacerbated disparities. Interventions to expand access resulted in late recovery volumes exceeding prepandemic volumes in patients with races other than White. CLINICAL IMPACT. Interventions to support equitable access across facilities serving diverse patient populations may mitigate potential widening disparities in breast cancer diagnosis during the pandemic.",,,American Journal of Roentgenology,,,Architectural Accessibility; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Mass Screening; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies,2021-11-24,2021,2021-11-24,2022-06,218,6,988-996,Closed,Article,"Lehman, Constance D; Mercaldo, Sarah F; Wang, Gary X; Dontchos, Brian N; Specht, Michelle C; Lamb, Leslie R","Lehman, Constance D (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114.); Mercaldo, Sarah F (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114.); Wang, Gary X (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114.); Dontchos, Brian N (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114.); Specht, Michelle C (Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.); Lamb, Leslie R (Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114.)",,"Lehman, Constance D (Harvard University); Mercaldo, Sarah F (Harvard University); Wang, Gary X (Harvard University); Dontchos, Brian N (Harvard University); Specht, Michelle C (Harvard University); Lamb, Leslie R (Harvard University)",17,13,1.63,7.47,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142921955,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

For breast cancer, early detection and treatment is key to improved survival and longer-term quality of life. Health services generally have been strained and in many settings with population breast mammography screening, efforts to diagnose and treat breast cancers earlier have been paused or have had reduced capacity. The resulting delays to diagnosis and treatment may lead to more intensive treatment requirements and, potentially, increased mortality. Modelled evaluations can support responses to the pandemic by estimating short- and long-term outcomes for various scenarios. Multiple calibrated and validated models exist for breast cancer screening, and some have been applied in 2020 to estimate the impact of breast screening disruptions and compare options for recovery, in a range of international settings. On behalf of the Covid and Cancer Modelling Consortium (CCGMC) Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer), we summarize and provide examples of such in a range of settings internationally, and propose priorities for future modelling exercises. International expert collaborations from the CCGMC Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer) will conduct analyses and modelling studies needed to inform key stakeholders recovery efforts in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.","Declaration of Competing Interest KC is co-principal investigator of an unrelated investigator-initiated trial of cervical screening in Australia (Compass; ACTRN12613001207707 and NCT02328872), which is conducted and funded by the VCS Foundation (VCS), a government-funded health promotion charity.

The need for second visits between screening mammography and diagnostic imaging contributes to disparities in the time to breast cancer diagnosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an immediate-read screening mammography program was implemented to reduce patient visits and decrease time to diagnostic imaging. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of an immediate-read screening program with focus on disparities in same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal findings are made at screening mammography. METHODS. In May 2020, an immediate-read screening program was implemented whereby a dedicated breast imaging radiologist interpreted all screening mammograms in real time; patients received results before discharge; and efforts were made to perform any recommended diagnostic imaging during the visit (performed by different radiologists). Screening mammographic examinations performed from June 1, 2019, through October 31, 2019 (preimplementation period), and from June 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020 (postimplementation period), were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics were recorded from the electronic medical record. Multivariable logistic regression models incorporating patient age, race and ethnicity, language, and insurance type were estimated to identify factors associated with same-day diagnostic imaging. Screening metrics were compared between periods. RESULTS. A total of 8222 preimplementation and 7235 postimplementation screening examinations were included; 521 patients had abnormal screening findings before implementation, and 359 after implementation. Before implementation, 14.8% of patients underwent same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. This percentage increased to 60.7% after implementation. Before implementation, patients who identified their race as other than White had significantly lower odds than patients who identified their race as White of undergoing same-day diagnostic imaging after receiving abnormal screening results (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.86; p = .03). After implementation, the odds of same-day diagnostic imaging were not significantly different between patients of other races and White patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.50-1.71; p = .80). After implementation, there was no significant difference in race and ethnicity between patients who underwent and those who did not undergo same-day diagnostic imaging after receiving abnormal results of screening mammography (p > .05). The rate of abnormal interpretation was significantly lower after than it was before implementation (5.0% vs 6.3%; p < .001). Cancer detection rate and PPV1 (PPV based on positive findings at screening examination) were not significantly different before and after implementation (p > .05). CONCLUSION. Implementation of the immediate-read screening mammography program reduced prior racial and ethnic disparities in same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. CLINICAL IMPACT.

We aimed to estimate incidence and mortality rates and numbers of new cases and deaths up until 2044 for all cancers combined and for 21 individual cancer types in Australia. We also illustrate the potential effect of treatment delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic on future colorectal cancer mortality rates.
METHODS: In this statistical modelling study, cancer incidence and mortality rates in Australia from 2020 to 2044 were projected based on data up to 2017 and 2019, respectively. Cigarette smoking exposure (1945-2019), participation rates in the breast cancer screening programme (1996-2019), and prostate-specific antigen testing rates (1994-2020) were included where relevant. The baseline projection model using an age-period-cohort model or generalised linear model for each cancer type was selected based on model fit statistics and validation with pre-COVID-19 observed data. To assess the impact of treatment delays during the COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer mortality, we obtained data on incidence, survival, prevalence, and cancer treatment for colorectal cancer from different authorities. The relative risks of death due to system-caused treatment delays were derived from a published systematic review. Numbers of excess colorectal cancer deaths were estimated using the relative risk of death per week of treatment delay and different durations of delay under a number of hypothetical scenarios.
FINDINGS: Projections indicate that in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic effects, the age-standardised incidence rate for all cancers combined for males would decline over 2020-44, and for females the incidence rate would be relatively stable in Australia. The mortality rates for all cancers combined for both males and females are expected to continuously decline during 2020-44. The total number of new cases are projected to increase by 47·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 35·2-61·3) for males, from 380 306 in 2015-19 to 560 744 (95% UI 514 244-613 356) in 2040-44, and by 54·4% (95% UI 40·2-70·5) for females, from 313 263 in 2015-19 to 483 527 (95% UI 439 069-534 090) in 2040-44. The number of cancer deaths are projected to increase by 36·4% (95% UI 15·3-63·9) for males, from 132 440 in 2015-19 to 180 663 (95% UI 152 719-217 126) in 2040-44, and by 36·6% (95% UI 15·8-64·1) for females, from 102 103 in 2015-19 to 139 482 (95% UI 118 186-167 527) in 2040-44, due to population ageing and growth. The example COVID-19 pandemic scenario of a 6-month health-care system disruption with 16-week treatment delays for colorectal cancer patients could result in 460 (95% UI 338-595) additional deaths and 437 (95% UI 314-570) deaths occurring earlier than expected in 2020-44.
INTERPRETATION: These projections can inform health service planning for cancer care and treatment in Australia. Despite the continuous decline in cancer mortality rates, and the decline or plateau in incidence rates, our projections suggest an overall 51% increase in the number of new cancer cases and a 36% increase in the number of cancer deaths over the 25-year projection period. This means that continued efforts to increase screening uptake and to control risk factors, including smoking exposure, obesity, physical inactivity, alcohol use, and infections, must remain public health priorities.

For two reasons: firstly it seemed to me so little time had passed since the previous issue about this disease and perhaps there weren't many new things to say and secondly I believed that the only topic worth discussing nowadays was the disease that overshadowed anything else: COVID-19. Nevertheless I realized that he was right. More than 3 years had passed since the previous issue and there were many updates related to this subject and COVID-19 or not, the treatment of breast cancer must continue. I am grateful to those who answered to my invitation to write an article. I was amazed by the huge number and the quality of the papers received. They were so numerous that we decided to have a supplement of the journal dedicated to breast cancer edited with the contribution of the Romanian Society of Breast Surgery and Oncology. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire planet in almost every aspect of life, including the medical system. The treatment of other diseases, other than COVID-19, has in some way become secondary, at least for the time being. This had immediate repercussions and will inevitably have a long-term impact as well. Breast cancer patients suffered consequently.

We developed Breast Cancer Champions (BCC) a peer-to-peer education program, which recruited 12 women and deployed them into the community in August 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. BCC aims to improve breast cancer screening rates for women of African heritage through peer-to-peer education, which has proven successful for addressing cancer-related health disparities.MethodsBCC community experts, or “Champions,” are peer-to-peer educators that conduct awareness and screening events in their communities. Champion’s education activities were tracked by bi-weekly check-in calls, which recorded the activity type, location, and the number of participants for each event. We used spatial and statistical analyses to determine the efficacy of the program at increasing screening rates for women within the area of Champion activity versus women outside of their activity area.ResultsOver 15 months, Champions conducted 245 in-person or online events to engage women in their community for screening. More women of African heritage were screened in areas Champions were active during the intervention compared to historical data comparing areas outside of the Champion activity in the prior 15 months (X2 = 3.0845, p = 0.079).ConclusionBCC successes could be attributed to pivoting to online community building when in-person events were restricted and enabling Champions to design and conduct their own events, which increased outreach possibilities. We demonstrate improved screening outcomes associated with an updated peer-to-peer education program.","We would like to thank all of the Champions who participated in this project.

We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France).MethodsAn IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13, 2020, for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features, and outcome. Data extraction was done on April 25, 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT scan abnormalities.ResultsAmong 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N = 41) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized, and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (> 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.ConclusionsThis prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment. Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.","Institut Curie Breast Cancer and COVID Group: Aurélia Alimi, Muriel Belotti, Okba Bensaoula, Ophélie Bertrand, Geoffroy Bilger, Etienne Brain, Hervé Brisse, Bruno Buecher, Laetitia Chanas, Caroline Chapus, Isabelle Charles-Massar, Pascal Chérel, Gilles Créhange, Christelle Colas, Hélène Delhomelle, Thomas Frederic-Moreau, Emmanuelle Fourme, Pierre Fumoleau, Marion Gauthier-Villars, Olivier Lantz, Sophie Lassalle, Marine Le Mentec, Florence Lerebours, Delphine Loirat, Matthieu Minsat, Pauline Moreau, Antoine de Pauw, Maël Priour, Fabien Reyal, Roman Rouzier, Mary Saad, Claire Saule, Clara Sebbag, Dominique Stoppa-Lyonnet, Anne Tardivon, Silvia Takanen, Dominique Vanjak, Marie-Charlotte Villy, Anne Vincent-Salomon, and Mathilde Warcoin.","FundingInstitut Curie, Université de Versailles Saint Quentin, and Université Paris-Saclay (no grant number applicable).

About 6 months before, she had noted the onset of right breast swelling accompanied by skin redness and itching. She never consulted a physician, and, over time, the local skin condition progressed to a large scaly plaque covering the entire breast surface including the nipple. At presentation, abduction of the right upper limb was impaired due to severe shoulder pain. CT scan showed the presence of bilateral breast masses with necrotic and colliquative features, and multiple skeletal, nodal, pulmonary, and brain images suggestive of metastases. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the contralateral breast showed grade 2 non-special type infiltrating carcinoma. The patient was referred to the breast oncology unit and is currently being treated with aromatase inhibitors and chemotherapy.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the entire spectrum of oncological care including breast cancer. Hopefully, telemedicine will contribute to increase patients’ confidence and will provide earlier diagnosis and treatment while minimizing the risk of contagion.","Acknowledgements

5055,pub.1145782391,,35195971,,[BREAST CANCER COMPLICATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - LESSONS LEARNT].,"INTRODUCTION: In their article published in this issue of Harefuah, Greenhouse et al. describe a complicated case of a woman with delayed diagnosis of breast cancer, presenting with spinal cord compression due to spin metastases and a locally advanced breast lesion. The patient had concurrent symptomatic infection with COVID-19, and was successfully diagnosed and treated, resulting in neurologic recovery. This case raises several issues, relevant to the care of patients with breast cancer. Late diagnosis of breast cancer is not uncommon, but little is known regarding the reasons why some women forego breast cancer screening or delay diagnosis of symptomatic breast lesions. Available information points at fear of breast cancer and fear of surgery as common causes, and it seems that interventions aimed to increase screening rates should take these findings into account. The patient described by Greenhouse et al. complained of back ache and was treated by telemedicine for a month preceding hospitalization, during the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. As the implementation of telemedicine increases, organizations should issue guidelines for its use. It seems prudent to avoid using telemedicine in patients with new symptoms or recurring symptoms without a definite diagnosis. There is currently sufficient data showing that breast cancer patients are not at higher risk for COVID-19 complications compared with the general population, even while treated for their cancer. Serologic studies performed in Israel following COVID-19 vaccination found that 85-90% of patients with solid tumors have positive serologic tests after the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Studies have estimated that delaying breast cancer screening during the pandemic would result in increased breast cancer mortality. Thus, efforts should be made to continue breast cancer screening, diagnostic workup of suspicious findings and treatment of confirmed breast cancer in the event of additional outbreaks of COVID-19.",,,Harefuah,,,"Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",2022-02,2022,,2022-02,161,2,101-103,Closed,Article,"Shai, Ayelet","Shai, Ayelet (Oncology Department, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya.; Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar Ilan University, Safed.)",,"Shai, Ayelet (Western Galilee Hospital; Bar-Ilan University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145782391,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The purpose of this study is to present side effects reported by a cohort of patients treated for breast cancer. A survey link was sent to 4945 women who received breast cancer treatment and were prospectively screened for breast cancer-related lymphedema. In total, 621 patients who received an mRNA vaccine and responded to the survey were included in analysis. We assessed the frequency and predictors of side effects. The most frequent side effects reported were injection site soreness, fatigue, generalized muscle soreness, headache, and chills, with median duration  ≤ 48 h. Lymph node swelling occurred most often in the axilla ipsilateral to the vaccine. The median duration was 1 week or less after all doses. These data will inform patient education regarding future vaccine doses, including reassurances about which side effects to expect, particularly lymph node swelling which may impact mammograms after vaccination. Type and duration of side effects were similar to that reported by the general population in Phase 3 testing trials of the mRNA vaccines.

METHODS: User data from a risk assessment company were collected from February 2 to April 11, 2020. The use of risk assessment was used as a proxy for the use of 3 breast cancer services, namely, breast imaging, breast surgery, and genetics consultation. Changes in the use of these services during the study period were analyzed.
RESULTS: All 3 services experienced significant declines after the COVID-19 outbreak. The decline in breast surgery began during the week of March 8, followed by breast imaging and genetics consultation (both of which began during the week of March 15). Breast imaging experienced the most significant reduction, with an average weekly decline of 61.7% and a maximum decline of 94.6%. Breast surgery demonstrated an average weekly decline of 20.5%. When surgical consultation was stratified as breast cancer versus no breast cancer, the decrease among in non-breast cancer patients was more significant than that of patients with breast cancer (a decline of 66.8% vs 11.5% from the pre-COVID average weekly volume for non-breast cancer patients and patients with breast cancer, respectively). During the week of April 5, use of genetics consultations dropped to 39.9% of the average weekly volumes before COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the number of patients undergoing breast cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment.","Conflict of Interest Disclosures Brian Drohan is an employee of CRA Health LLC, which provided the data for the current study, and he assisted in the analysis.

Equitable access to treatment has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, however geographical disparities have been reported which remain poorly understood. The purpose of our study was to explore women and clinicians' experience of geographic access to systemic anti-cancer therapies for the treatment of secondary breast cancer.
METHOD: The study setting was the integrated cancer system across the northwest region of Greater Manchester UK. A pragmatic qualitative study design was used. Women aged >18 years with a confirmed SBC diagnosis and clinicians responsible for the care and treatment of women with a secondary breast cancer diagnosis were interviewed using semi structured interviews to elicit their experience and perspectives on geographic access to treatment. Data were analysed using thematic analysis to identify emergent themes.
RESULTS: Eighteen interviews with women and 12 interviews with clinicians were completed. Four meta-themes were identified for geographic access, the influence of the health care system, person centred factors and the impact of Covid-19 on treatment access and receipt.
CONCLUSION: Our study was the first of its kind to explore women and clinicians experience of geographic access to systemic anti-cancer therapies for the treatment of secondary breast cancer. Findings provided a greater understanding of distance decay and the influence of the health care system on treatment access. This included the importance and availability of clinical trials as a potential treatment option.

Goserelin, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, has emerged among the various modalities as a preferred option for ovarian function suppression, owing to its efficacy in reducing ovarian estrogen production in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Recent studies have affirmed the efficacy and safety of long-acting (LA) goserelin 10.8 mg every 12 weeks, offering comparable outcomes to monthly injections. This flexibility enables personalized treatment approaches, potentially enhancing patient satisfaction. Off-label utilization of goserelin LA surged during the coronavirus disease pandemic, prompting initiatives to broaden its use for breast cancer treatment. Switching to goserelin LA can streamline treatment, boost adherence, and optimize resource utilization. With the recent approval of goserelin 10.8 mg LA by Health Canada on 6 May 2024, for use in breast cancer, Canada is the latest to join over 60 countries worldwide to expand the accepted indications for goserelin LA and ensure its availability to potentially enhance healthcare delivery, patient care, and breast cancer outcomes. Goserelin LA offers premenopausal patients a means to more effectively manage the constraints imposed by breast cancer treatment and its impact on survivorship.","Medical writing support was provided by Vamsi Ahobila and LoAn K.

Findings of a health equity audit conducted by the Pavia Healthcare Protection Agency (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy)","OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the disparities in access to cancer screening programmes in the Province of Pavia (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy), along with identifying the factors influencing these disparities; to assess the impact of the pandemic emergency on invitation and screening coverage in the three organized screening programmes, which are provided free of charge to the target population.
DESIGN: observational retrospective study covering both the pre-pandemic and the pandemic periods.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: for breast cancer screening, the eligible population comprises women aged 45 to 74; colorectal cancer screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74; cervical cancer screening is tailored based on women age. The management of all three screening programmes is overseen by the Health Protection Agency of Pavia, which proactively invites the eligible population through invitation letters.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: for each screening programme, the examination coverage (the number of screened individuals out of the total eligible population) was analysed considering its influencing factors, with a specific emphasis on equity-related factors such as demographics (sex, age), geographic factors (country and continent of birth, residential district), comorbidities.
RESULTS: the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a reorganization of healthcare services and to a reduction of the offer, resulting in an overall reduction in test coverage for all three programmes (-16.3% for breast and colorectal cancer screening, -8.5% for cervical cancer screening). The disparities in coverage among various population groups, reflecting inequalities in access, further escalated from the pre-pandemic to the pandemic period. Noteworthy, equity-related predictors of reduced screening access were non-Italian nationality and residency in rural or mountainous districts.
CONCLUSIONS: during periods of healthcare system strain, such as the pandemic, disparities in access can become more pronounced.

To trace infection chains, Germany launched its smartphone contact tracing app, the ""Corona-Warn-App"" (CWA), in June 2020. In order to be successful as a tool for fighting the pandemic, a high adoption rate is required in the population. We analyse the respective factors influencing app adoption based on the health belief model (HBM) with a cross-sectional online study including 1752 participants from Germany. The study was conducted with a certified panel provider from the end of December 2020 to January 2021. This model is primarily known from evaluations of medical treatments, such as breast cancer screenings, but it was rarely applied in prior work for a health-related information system such as the CWA. Our results indicate that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to use the CWA are the strongest drivers of app use.

There is a growing interest in using evidence-based priority setting processes, such as Health Technology Assessment (HTA), to inform these decisions. In 2020, the Palestinian Institute of Public Health (PNIPH) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) initiated a pilot to test the feasibility of coproducing an HTA on breast cancer screening in the West Bank, occupied Palestinian Territory. Additionally, a secondary aim was to test whether using an adaptive HTA (aHTA) approach that searched and transferred published evidence syntheses could increase the speed of HTA production.
METHODS: The applied stepwise approach to the HTA is described in detail and can be summarized as defining a core team, topic selection, and prioritization; undertaking the HTA including adaptation using tools from the European Network for HTA (EUnetHTA) and stakeholder engagement; and concluding with dissemination.
RESULTS: The aHTA approach was faster but not as quick as anticipated, which is attributed to (i) the lack of availability of local evidence for contextualizing findings and (ii) the necessity to build trust between the team and stakeholders. Some delays followed from the COVID-19 pandemic, which showed the importance of good risk anticipation and mitigation. Lastly, other important lessons included the ability of virtual collaborations, the value of capacity strengthening initiatives within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and the need for early stakeholder engagement. Overall, the pilot was successfully completed.
CONCLUSION: This was the first HTA of its kind produced in Palestine, and despite the challenges, it shows that HTA analysis is feasible in this setting.","We are grateful to Sawsan Abusharia, the Head of the Community Health Department; Hadil Almasri, the Head of the Women’s Health Department; Ibrahim Elayyan, the Head of the Medical Engineering Unit; and Samer Jaber, from the Palestinian Ministry of Finance, for their support of this study and their continuous cooperation.","This study received financial support from the Palestinian National Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether breast screening performance on a test-set based assessment scheme (PERFORMS) varied over time, in association with the lockdown period.
METHOD: In this retrospective study, performance data were obtained for all breast cancer screening readers in England who completed the PERFORMS schemes based on digital mammography (from 2015 to 2022). Cancer detection (sensitivity), correct return to screen (specificity) and the difference between the sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each breast screener in each PERFORMS scheme.
RESULTS: During the study period, 4906 readers participated in eight PERFORMS schemes. Both the cancer detection (H(7) = 775.56, p <.00001) and correct return to screen rate (H(7) = 401.13, p <.00001) varied significantly by scheme. The difference between cancer detection and correct return to screen rate in the scheme administered during the lockdown period was significantly higher than in all other schemes (p <.05, Bonferroni correction applied).
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of breast screeners on the PERFORMS test-set based assessment scheme which was administered during the lockdown period, was characterised by markedly high sensitivity and low specificity when compared to their performance on other tests taken pre-COVID and following the lockdown.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Dr Yan Chen declares activities related to the present work: disclosed grant money paid to author’s institution by the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme through Public Health England.

However, the total deficit in screening in the US associated with the pandemic and the differential impact on individuals in different geographic regions and by socioeconomic status (SES) index have yet to be fully characterized.
Objectives: To quantify the screening rates for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in different geographic regions and for individuals in different SES index quartiles and estimate the overall cancer screening deficit in 2020 across the US population.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study uses the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, which comprises single-payer administrative claims data and enrollment information covering approximately 60 million people in Medicare Advantage and commercial health plans from across geographically diverse regions of the US. Participants were individuals in the database in January through July of 2018, 2019, and 2020 without diagnosis of the cancer of interest prior to the analytic index month.
Exposures: Analytic index month and year.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening.
Results: Screening for all 3 cancers declined sharply in March through May of 2020 compared with 2019, with the sharpest decline in April (breast, -90.8%; colorectal, -79.3%; prostate, -63.4%) and near complete recovery of monthly screening rates by July for breast and prostate cancers. The absolute deficit across the US population in screening associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be 3.9 million (breast), 3.8 million (colorectal), and 1.6 million (prostate). Geographic differences were observed: the Northeast experienced the sharpest declines in screening, while the West had a slower recovery compared with the Midwest and South. For example, percentage change in breast cancer screening rate (2020 vs 2019) for the month of April ranged from -87.3% (95% CI, -87.9% to -86.7%) in the West to -94.5% (95% CI, -94.9% to -94.1%) in the Northeast (decline). For the month of July, it ranged from -0.3% (95% CI, -2.1% to 1.5%) in the Midwest to -10.6% (-12.6% to -8.4%) in the West (recovery). By SES, the largest screening decline was observed in individuals in the highest SES index quartile, leading to a narrowing in the disparity in cancer screening by SES in 2020. For example, prostate cancer screening rates per 100 000 enrollees for individuals in the lowest and highest SES index quartiles, respectively, were 3525 (95% CI, 3444 to 3607) and 4329 (95% CI, 4271 to 4386) in April 2019 compared with 1535 (95% CI, 1480 to 1589) and 1338 (95% CI, 1306 to 1370) in April 2020. Multivariable analysis showed that telehealth use was associated with higher cancer screening.
Conclusions and Relevance: Public health efforts are needed to address the large cancer screening deficit associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased use of screening modalities that do not require a procedure.",,,JAMA Oncology,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Male; Medicare; Pandemics; Prostatic Neoplasms; SARS-CoV-2; Social Class; Telemedicine; United States,2021-06-01,2021,2021-06-17,2021-06-01,7,6,878-884,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Chen, Ronald C; Haynes, Kevin; Du, Simo; Barron, John; Katz, Aaron J","Chen, Ronald C (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City.); Haynes, Kevin (Scientific Affairs, HealthCore, Inc, Wilmington, Delaware.); Du, Simo (Scientific Affairs, HealthCore, Inc, Wilmington, Delaware.); Barron, John (Scientific Affairs, HealthCore, Inc, Wilmington, Delaware.); Katz, Aaron J (Department of Population Health, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City.)","Chen, Ronald C (University of Kansas Medical Center)","Chen, Ronald C (University of Kansas Medical Center); Haynes, Kevin (Elevance Health (United States)); Du, Simo (Elevance Health (United States)); Barron, John (Elevance Health (United States)); Katz, Aaron J (University of Kansas Medical Center)",251,138,19.92,76.71,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/articlepdf/2778916/jamaoncology_chen_2021_oi_210010_1623351995.44354.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137622007,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Hispanic breast cancer patients may be more vulnerable due to a lack of resources and language barriers, widening disparities in cancer care. This qualitative study explored the challenges and obstacles to cancer care during the COVID pandemic among 27 Hispanic females from a United States-Mexico border region. Data were collected via individual in-depth interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. The majority of the participants were interviewed in Spanish. More than half (55.6%, n = 15) were diagnosed with breast cancer within the prior year to the interview. One-third of the participants (33.3%, n = 9) reported that COVID somewhat to greatly impacted their cancer care. Study findings revealed potential barriers and challenges for cancer care at multiple levels (e.g., medical, psychosocial, financial level) during the COVID pandemic. Five major themes reported include: (1) delays in testing and access to care; (2) fear of COVID infection; (3) social isolation and reduced social support; (4) challenges in navigating treatments alone; and (5) financial hardships. Our findings highlight the importance for health care practitioners to understand various challenges encountered by underserved Hispanic breast cancer patients due to COVID. Screening for psychological distress and exploring approaches to expand social support to address these challenges are discussed.","We would like to express our appreciation to the participants for their valuable input.

In some cases, patients develop symptoms of psychological distress after the diagnosis, which can have a negative influence during and after treatment. In Quebec, there are several breast cancer clinics that appear to offer psychological assessment to patients and psychosocial services during the different phases of the disease. To our knowledge, few Quebec studies have looked at the effectiveness of and access to psychosocial services in times of non-crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic also led to changes in breast clinics (e.g., closure of screening clinics, reception of diagnosis remotely, changes in treatment plans). However, no Canadian study has qualitatively examined patients' experiences of the impact of the pandemic on access and effectiveness of these services. Objectives The first objective of this qualitative study is to describe the perspectives of Quebec women who received a breast cancer diagnosis and/or treatment during the pandemic on the access to and effectiveness of psychosocial services. In addition, the second objective is to identify patient recommendations for improving the well-being of patients receiving psychosocial oncology services. Method As part of this larger project, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 Quebec patients (M = 47.05 years, SD = 9.07) diagnosed and/or treated for breast cancer before and during the pandemic. Descriptive analyses performed in MaxQDA allowed us to establish a thematic guide and narrative summaries. Results A minority of participants (n = 6) were offered psychosocial services at the time of their diagnosis. Although not all of them used the resources offered, they appreciated having them available. In contrast, 12 participants did not receive psychosocial resources, and more than half of these women were unsatisfied as they experienced intense psychological distress following diagnosis, which continued during treatment. Many women (n = 12) had to seek help on their own. Conclusion In order to improve the long-term experience of patients in times of crisis and non-crisis in Quebec, the results show that it could be beneficial to offer psychosocial services based on the needs of users, rather than solely on the severity of psychological symptoms.",,,Santé mentale au Québec,,,Humans; COVID-19; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Quebec; Qualitative Research; Health Services Accessibility; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; Psychosocial Intervention; Pandemics,2024-07-16,2024,2024-07-16,2024,49,1,27-48,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fortin, Justine; Defer, Clarisse; Brunet, Alain; Montreuil, Marjorie; Marin, Marie-France","Fortin, Justine (Département de psychologie, Université du Québec à Montréal, Québec, Canada.); Defer, Clarisse (Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, Québec, Canada.); Brunet, Alain (Département de psychiatrie, Université McGill, Québec, Canada.); Montreuil, Marjorie (Département de psychiatrie, Université McGill, Québec, Canada.); Marin, Marie-France (Département de psychologie, Université du Québec à Montréal, Québec, Canada.)",,"Fortin, Justine (University of Quebec in Montreal); Defer, Clarisse (Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont); Brunet, Alain (McGill University); Montreuil, Marjorie (McGill University); Marin, Marie-France (University of Quebec in Montreal)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.7202/1112525ar,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174342613,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

A Multicentric Analysis of 432 Patients,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Extraordinary restrictions aimed to limit Sars-CoV-2 spreading; they imposed a total reorganization of the health-system. Oncological treatments experienced a significant slowdown. The aim of our multicentric retrospective study was to evaluate screening suspension and surgical treatment delay during COVID-19 and the impact on breast cancer presentation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent breast surgery from March 11, 2020 to May 30, 2020 were evaluated and considered as the Lockdown group. These patients were compared with similar patients of the previous year, the Pre-Lockdown group.
RESULTS: A total of 432 patients were evaluated; n=223 and n=209 in the Lockdown and Pre-lockdown-groups, respectively. At univariate analysis, waiting times, lymph-nodes involvement and cancer grading, showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis identified waiting-time on list (OR=1.07) as a statistically significant predictive factor of lymph node involvement.
CONCLUSION: Although we did not observe a clinically evident difference in breast cancer presentation, we reported an increase in lymph node involvement.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",,Anticancer Research,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Axilla; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy",2020-12-07,2020,2020-12-07,2020-12,40,12,7119-7125,All OA; Green,Article,"VANNI, GIANLUCA; TAZZIOLI, GIOVANNI; PELLICCIARO, MARCO; MATERAZZO, MARCO; PAOLO, ORSARIA; CATTADORI, FRANCESCA; COMBI, FRANCESCA; PAPI, SIMONA; PISTOLESE, CHIARA ADRIANA; COTESTA, MARIA; SANTORI, FRANCESCA; CASPI, JONATHAN; CHIARAVALLOTI, AGOSTINO; MUSCOLI, SAVERIO; LOMBARDO, VITTORIO; GRASSO, ANTONELLA; CAGGIATI, LORENZA; RASELLI, ROBERTA; PALLI, DANTE; ALTOMARE, VITTORIO; D’ANGELILLO, ROLANDO MARIA; PALOMBI, LEONARDO; BUONOMO, ORESTE CLAUDIO","VANNI, GIANLUCA (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, PTV: Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy;); TAZZIOLI, GIOVANNI (Division of Breast Surgical Oncology Department of Medical and Surgery, Maternal-infantile and Adult Sciences, University Hospital of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy); PELLICCIARO, MARCO (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, PTV: Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy;); MATERAZZO, MARCO (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, PTV: Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy;); PAOLO, ORSARIA (Department of Breast Surgery, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy); CATTADORI, FRANCESCA (Breast Surgery, Breast Unit, “Guglielmo da Saliceto” Hospital, Piacenza, Italy); COMBI, FRANCESCA (Division of Breast Surgical Oncology Department of Medical and Surgery, Maternal-infantile and Adult Sciences, University Hospital of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy 3Department of Breast Surgery, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy 4Breast Surgery, Breast Unit, “Guglielmo da Saliceto” Hospital, Piacenza, Italy 5PhD Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy;); PAPI, SIMONA (Division of Breast Surgical Oncology Department of Medical and Surgery, Maternal-infantile and Adult Sciences, University Hospital of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy); PISTOLESE, CHIARA ADRIANA (Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Molecular Imaging and Radiotherapy, Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); COTESTA, MARIA (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, PTV: Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy;); SANTORI, FRANCESCA (Breast Unit, Department of Surgical Science, PTV: Policlinico Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy;); CASPI, JONATHAN (Tor Vergata School of Medicine and Surgery, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); CHIARAVALLOTI, AGOSTINO (Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy; 9IRCCS Neuromed, UOC Medicina Nucleare, Pozzilli, Italy); MUSCOLI, SAVERIO (Department of Cardiovascular Disease, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); LOMBARDO, VITTORIO (Department of General Surgery, I.R.C.C.S.

More than 3300 participants took part in this important bi-annual critical review of the 'state of the art' in the multidisciplinary care of early-stage breast cancer. Seventy-four expert panelists (see Appendix 1) from all continents discussed and commented on the previously elaborated consensus questions, as well as many key questions on early breast cancer diagnosis and treatment asked by the audience. The theme of this year's conference was 'Customizing local and systemic therapies.' A well-organized program of pre-recorded symposia, live panel discussions and real-time panel voting results drew a worldwide audience of thousands, reflecting the far-reaching impact of breast cancer on every continent. The interactive technology platform allowed, for the first time, audience members to ask direct questions to panelists, and to weigh in with their own vote on several key panel questions. A hallmark of this meeting was to focus on customized recommendations for treatment of early-stage breast cancer. There is increasing recognition that the care of a breast cancer patient depends on highly individualized clinical features, including the stage at presentation, the biological subset of breast cancer, the genetic factors that may underlie breast cancer risk, the genomic signatures that inform treatment recommendations, the extent of response before surgery in patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy, and patient preferences. This customized approach to treatment requires integration of clinical care between patients and radiology, pathology, genetics, and surgical, medical and radiation oncology providers. It also requires a dynamic response from clinicians as they encounter accumulating clinical information at the time of diagnosis and then serially with each step in the treatment plan and follow-up, reflecting patient experiences and treatment response.",Funding None declared.

Though advancements in breast cancer care have improved patient survival, a breast cancer diagnosis, and subsequent interventions have a lasting impact on patients' lived experiences during the pandemic.
METHODS: We present the collaborative learning process from this patient engagement workshop series as a community-academic partnership. Narrative medicine tools were used to recount patients' lived experiences following diagnosis, where both patients and researchers shared their cancer research activities in each workshop, and the role of the multidisciplinary healthcare team was discussed.
KEY FINDINGS: We used an iterative approach to cohort building, narrative development, and the use of multiple media formats to capture stories. Over 20 patients with breast cancer shared their stories for the first time since their diagnosis with a wider audience. Here, we present the learning process and considerations from this event.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding patients' lived experiences can support researchers and healthcare professionals in developing an empathetic approach to shared healthcare decision making. Moreover, understanding the lived experiences of patients is critical to addressing disparities in healthcare.",The authors are sincerely grateful for the contributions from all patient participants who bravely shared their stories. We thank staff at the NHS Lanarkshire breast clinic for enabling the recruitment of patients to the engagement event.

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, stage and initial treatment of breast cancer.
MethodsWomen included in the Netherlands Cancer Registry and diagnosed during four periods in weeks 2–17 of 2020 were compared with reference data from 2018/2019 (averaged). Weekly incidence was calculated by age group and tumor stage. The number of women receiving initial treatment within 3 months of diagnosis was calculated by period, initial treatment, age, and stage. Initial treatment, stratified by tumor behavior (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or invasive), was analyzed by logistic regression and adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, stage, subtype, and region. Factors influencing time to treatment were analyzed by Cox regression.ResultsIncidence declined across all age groups and tumor stages (except stage IV) from 2018/2019 to 2020, particularly for DCIS and stage I disease (p < 0.05). DCIS was less likely to be treated within 3 months (odds ratio [OR]wks2–8: 2.04, ORwks9–11: 2.18). Invasive tumors were less likely to be treated initially by mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (ORwks12–13: 0.52) or by breast conserving surgery (ORwks14–17: 0.75). Chemotherapy was less likely for tumors diagnosed in the beginning of the study period (ORwks9–11: 0.59, ORwks12–13: 0.66), but more likely for those diagnosed at the end (ORwks14–17: 1.31). Primary hormonal treatment was more common (ORwks2–8: 1.23, ORwks9–11: 1.92, ORwks12–13: 3.01). Only women diagnosed in weeks 2–8 of 2020 experienced treatment delays.ConclusionThe incidence of breast cancer fell in early 2020, and treatment approaches adapted rapidly. Clarification is needed on how this has affected stage migration and outcomes.","We thank the NCR for providing the data and their data managers for collecting that data.

METHODS: Prospective observational study in which demographic, comorbidity and outcome data from a consecutive cohort of patients diagnosed and treated between September 2019 to September 2021 were collected. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score was calculated for all and proportion of each comorbidity was determined at diagnosis (baseline), at conclusion and six-months post-treatment. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done for impact of various demographic and disease-related factors on the incidence of comorbidities as well as on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Out of five hundred patients who consented for the study, 416 patients completed planned treatment and only 206 patients had physical follow-up due to COVID-19 pandemic. Incidence of comorbidity at the three time-points was 24%, 32% and 26% respectively. The difference was significant compared to baseline at both the time-points (p<0.05). Hypertension and diabetes were the most common types (incidence 15%-21% and 12-18% respectively) of comorbidities. Advancing age, post-menopauusal status and not being married were significant factors for presence of comorbidities. Median follow-up was 27 months (95% CI 26.25-28.55 months). Presence of multiple comorbidities was a poor prognostic factor for both PFS (2-yr PFS 85% vs 77%) and OS (2-yr OS 89% vs 79%) (both p=0.04) but no such correlation for CCI score.
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer treatment impacted incidence of comorbidities. Presence of multiple comorbidities had an adverse impact on survival. Hence, further research on treatment optimization is required in patients with substantial comorbidities.","The project received funding support from the Women’s Cancer Initiative and Nag Foundation and International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai.",,Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,,,Humans; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Incidence; Pandemics; Comorbidity; India,2023-11-01,2023,2023-11-01,2023-11-01,24,11,3805-3814,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wadasadawala, Tabassum; Datta, Debanjali; Puchali, Namita; Rane, Pallavi; Sen, Soumendu; Mohanty, Sanjay; Gupta, Sudeep; Sarin, Rajiv; Parmar, Vani","Wadasadawala, Tabassum (Department of Radiation Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.); Datta, Debanjali (Department of Radiation Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.); Puchali, Namita (Department of Clinical Research and Statistics, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.); Rane, Pallavi (Department of Clinical Research and Statistics, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.); Sen, Soumendu (Department of Fertility Studies, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India.); Mohanty, Sanjay (Department of Fertility Studies, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India.); Gupta, Sudeep (Department of Medical Oncology,Tata Memorial Center, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.); Sarin, Rajiv (Department of Radiation Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.); Parmar, Vani (Department of Surgical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.)","Wadasadawala, Tabassum (Tata Memorial Centre; Homi Bhabha National Institute)","Wadasadawala, Tabassum (Tata Memorial Centre; Homi Bhabha National Institute); Datta, Debanjali (Tata Memorial Centre; Homi Bhabha National Institute); Puchali, Namita (Homi Bhabha National Institute); Rane, Pallavi (Homi Bhabha National Institute); Sen, Soumendu (International Institute for Population Sciences); Mohanty, Sanjay (International Institute for Population Sciences); Gupta, Sudeep (Tata Memorial Centre; Homi Bhabha National Institute); Sarin, Rajiv (Tata Memorial Centre; Homi Bhabha National Institute); Parmar, Vani (Tata Memorial Centre; Homi Bhabha National Institute)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.31557/apjcp.2023.24.11.3805,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166442773,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Furthermore, 1.82 million booster doses have been administered in the US since 13th August, and similar booster programmes are currently planned or under consideration in the UK and the EU beginning in the autumn of 2021. Early reports showed an association between vaccine administration and the development of ipsilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, which could interfere with the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of breast cancer patients. In this paper, we review the available evidence on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy, and we discuss the clinical implications of the same on breast cancer diagnosis and management.
METHODS: A literature search was performed - PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, CINHAL, Springer Nature, ScienceDirect, Academic Search Premier and the Directory of Open Access Journals were searched for articles reporting on regional palpable or image-detected lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination. Separately, we compiled a series of case studies from the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, United Kingdom and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, United States of America, to illustrate the impact that regional lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination can have on the diagnosis and management of patients being seen in diagnostic and therapeutic breast clinics.
RESULTS: From the literature search, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 2057 patients, 737 with lymphadenopathy). The incidence of lymphadenopathy ranged between 14.5% and 53% and persisted for >6 weeks in 29% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians managing breast cancer patients should be aware that the COVID-19 vaccination may result in regional lymphadenopathy in a significant number of patients, which can result in unnecessary investigations, treatment and increased patient anxiety. An accurate COVID-19 vaccination history should be collected from all patients where regional lymphadenopathy is a clinical and/or an imaging finding and then combined with clinical judgement when managing individual cases.",Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",European Journal of Cancer,,,"Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19 Vaccines; Diagnosis, Differential; Diagnostic Errors; Female; Humans; Incidence; Lymphadenopathy; Mammography; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Vaccination",2021-10-11,2021,2021-10-11,2021-12,159,,38-51,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Garreffa, Emanuele; Hamad, Ahmed; O'Sullivan, Ciara C; Hazim, Antonious Z; York, Joanne; Puri, Shama; Turnbull, Anne; Robertson, John F; Goetz, Matthew P","Garreffa, Emanuele (Breast Surgery, University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, Derby, UK.

We estimated the long-term clinical impact of breast and colorectal cancer screening interruptions in Canada using a validated mathematical model.
METHODS: We used the OncoSim breast and colorectal cancers microsimulation models to explore scenarios of primary screening stops for 3, 6, and 12 months followed by 6-24-month transition periods of reduced screening volumes. For breast cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, additional advanced-stage cases diagnosed, and excess cancer deaths in 2020-2029. For colorectal cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, undiagnosed advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers in 2020, and lifetime excess cancer incidence and deaths.
RESULTS: Our simulations projected a surge of cancer cases when screening resumes. For breast cancer screening, a three-month interruption could increase cases diagnosed at advanced stages (310 more) and cancer deaths (110 more) in 2020-2029. A six-month interruption could lead to 670 extra advanced cancers and 250 additional cancer deaths. For colorectal cancers, a six-month suspension of primary screening could increase cancer incidence by 2200 cases with 960 more cancer deaths over the lifetime. Longer interruptions, and reduced volumes when screening resumes, would further increase excess cancer deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Interruptions in cancer screening will lead to additional cancer deaths, additional advanced cancers diagnosed, and a surge in demand for downstream resources when screening resumes. An effective strategy is needed to minimize potential harm to people who missed their screening.","We would like to thank the following individuals for their expertise and help with this project: Beverley Essue and Natalie Fitzgerald, and the OncoSim-Breast and OncoSim-Colorectal technical working groups that oversaw the development of the OncoSim-Breast and OncoSim-Colorectal cancer models.","Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: OncoSim is led and supported by the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, with model development by Statistics Canada, and is made possible through funding from Health Canada.",Journal of Medical Screening,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Canada; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male,2020-11-26,2020,2020-11-26,2021-06,28,2,100-107,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Yong, Jean HE; Mainprize, James G; Yaffe, Martin J; Ruan, Yibing; Poirier, Abbey E; Coldman, Andrew; Nadeau, Claude; Iragorri, Nicolas; Hilsden, Robert J; Brenner, Darren R","Yong, Jean HE (Independent Consultant, Toronto, Canada); Mainprize, James G (Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada); Yaffe, Martin J (Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada; Departments of Medical Biophysics and Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); Ruan, Yibing (Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada); Poirier, Abbey E (Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada); Coldman, Andrew (British Columbia Cancer Research, Vancouver, Canada); Nadeau, Claude (Statistics Canada, Ottawa, Canada); Iragorri, Nicolas (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); Hilsden, Robert J (Forzani & MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada; Departments of Medicine and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada); Brenner, Darren R (Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada; Departments of Oncology and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada)","Yaffe, Martin J (University of Toronto; University of Toronto)","Yong, Jean HE (Independent Consultant, Toronto, Canada); Mainprize, James G (University of Toronto); Yaffe, Martin J (University of Toronto; University of Toronto); Ruan, Yibing (Alberta Health Services); Poirier, Abbey E (Alberta Health Services); Coldman, Andrew (BC Cancer Agency); Nadeau, Claude (Statistics Canada); Iragorri, Nicolas (University of Toronto); Hilsden, Robert J (Alberta Health Services; University of Calgary); Brenner, Darren R (Alberta Health Services; University of Calgary)",165,66,13.06,52.51,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969141320974711,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132950073,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought ACE2 into the spotlight, and ACE2 expression in tumors and its relationship with SARS-COV-2 infection and prognosis of cancer patients have received extensive attention. However, the association between ACE2 expression and tumor therapy and prognosis, especially in breast cancer, remains ambiguous and requires further investigation. We have previously reported that ACE2 is elevated in drug-resistant breast cancer cells, but the exact function of ACE2 in drug resistance and progression of this malignant disease has not been explored.MethodsThe expression of ACE2 and HIF-1α in parental and drug-resistant breast cancer cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions was analyzed by Western blot and qRT-PCR methods. The protein levels of ACE2 in plasma samples from breast cancer patients were examined by ELISA. The relationship between ACE2 expression and breast cancer treatment and prognosis was analyzed using clinical specimens and public databases. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in breast cancer cells were measured by using a fluorescent probe. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or lentivirus-mediated shRNA was used to silence ACE2 and HIF-1α expression in cellular models. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on drug resistance in breast cancer was determined by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8)-based assay, colony formation assay, apoptosis and EdU assay.ResultsACE2 expression is relatively low in breast cancer cells, but increases rapidly and specifically after exposure to anticancer drugs, and remains high after resistance is acquired. Mechanistically, chemotherapeutic agents increase ACE2 expression in breast cancer cells by inducing intracellular ROS production, and increased ROS levels enhance AKT phosphorylation and subsequently increase HIF-1α expression, which in turn upregulates ACE2 expression. Although ACE2 levels in plasma and cancer tissues are lower in breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls, elevated ACE2 in patients after chemotherapy is a predictor of poor treatment response and an unfavorable prognostic factor for survival in breast cancer patients.ConclusionACE2 is a gene in breast cancer cells that responds rapidly to chemotherapeutic agents through the ROS-AKT-HIF-1α axis. Elevated ACE2 modulates the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to anticancer drugs by optimizing the balance of intracellular ROS. Moreover, increased ACE2 is not only a predictor of poor response to chemotherapy, but is also associated with a worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, our findings provide novel insights into the spatiotemporal differences in the function of ACE2 in the initiation and progression of breast cancer.",Not applicable.,"This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Numbers 82073252, 81772804, 81903092, and 82073085), Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission (Number 20JCZDJC00030), and Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team (Number IRT_14R40).",Journal of Translational Medicine,,,"Humans;

Eventually, an increased in size of the axillary lymph nodes may lead to a misinterpretation of the breast screening mammogram, performed in asymptomatic women between the age 50 to 69 years old for early breast cancer diagnosis. The aim of our research was to evaluate the impact of the vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 in the breast screening programmes in terms of recall rates and number of false positive results. As a secondary purpose we would analysed the protocols adopted by different breast screening units around the world after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
METHODS: Observational and retrospective study analysing breast screening mammograms from a single Breast Cancer Screening Unit in Madrid. The mammograms of previously vaccinated women were analysed, reviewing the axillary lymph nodes and the re-call rate secondary to axillary lymphadenopathies.
RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty three screening mammograms were performed in May 2021 in the University Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, which is part of the Breast Screening Programme in Madrid, Spain. None of the women previously vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 were recalled for complementary studies due to an increased in the axillary lymph nodes.

A tele-mammography network could improve access to breast cancer screening decreasing its mortality. This research aims to conduct an economic evaluation of the implementation of a tele-mammography program to improve access to healthcare.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to explore the incremental benefit of annual tele-mammography screening for at-risk Argentinian women over 40 years old. A Markov model was developed to simulate annual mammography or tele-mammography screening in two hypothetical population-based cohorts of asymptomatic women. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Model structure uncertainty was also explored to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: It was estimated that 31 out of 100 new cases of breast cancer would be detected by mammography and 39/100 by tele-mammography. The model returned an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £26 051/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) which is lower than the WHO-recommended threshold of £26 288/QALY for Argentina. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed the ICER is most sensitive to the uptake and sensitivity of the screening tests. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed tele-mammography is cost-effective in 59% of simulations.
DISCUSSION: Tele-mammography should be considered for adoption as it could improve access to expertise in underserved areas where adherence to screening protocols is poor. Disaggregated data by province is needed for a better- informed policy decision. Telemedicine could also be beneficial in ensuring the continuity of care when health systems are under stress like in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 22,481 adult breast cancer survivors who were active members of a large California integrated healthcare plan in 2020. We collected data on their breast cancer diagnosis, comorbidity, and demographic characteristics. We examined SARS-CoV-2 testing utilization between March 2020 and September 2020 by race or ethnicity, comorbidity, and other patient characteristics. We also examined the correlates of a having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of testing utilization and test positivity.
RESULTS: Of these 22,481 women, 3,288 (14.6%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The cohort included 51.8% women of color. Of the 3,288 tested, 264 (8.0%) women had a positive test result. In multivariable analyses, Latinx survivors were more likely (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.34) to undergo testing than White survivors; however, Asian or Pacific Islander survivors were 16% less likely to get tested (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94). Compared to White survivors, Latinx survivors were 3.5 times (adjusted OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.52 to 4.77) and Asian or Pacific Islander or Other survivors were 2.2-fold (adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.34) more likely to test positive. Being overweight (adjusted OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.72) or obese (adjusted OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.98) were also strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity.
CONCLUSION: Even in an integrated healthcare system, Asian or Pacific Islander patients were less likely to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing than White survivors, but more likely to test positive. Additionally, Latinx ethnicity and high body mass index were strongly correlated with a greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity.",,,JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; California; Cancer Survivors; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2",2021-12,2021,,2021-12,5,5,168-175,Closed,Article,"Haque, Reina; Chen, LieHong","Haque, Reina (Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA.; Kaiser Permanente Bernard J.

Little is known about whether health care access and preventive health screenings among US adults have recovered to prepandemic levels, and how patterns varied by race and ethnicity.
Objective: To evaluate health care access and preventive health screenings among eligible US adults in 2021 and 2022 compared with prepandemic year 2019, overall and by race and ethnicity.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from US adults aged 18 years or older who participated in the National Health Interview Survey in 2021 and 2022. Survey weights provided by the National Health Interview Survey were used to generate nationally representative estimates. Data were analyzed from May 23 to November 13, 2023.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Measures of health care access included the proportion of adults with a usual place for care, those with a wellness visit, and those who delayed or did not receive medical care due to cost within the past year. Preventive health screening measures included eligible adults who received blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood glucose screening within the past year (2021), as well as colorectal, cervical, breast, and prostate cancer screenings based on US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.
Results: The unweighted study population included 89 130 US adults. The weighted population included 51.6% females; 16.8% Hispanic, 5.9% non-Hispanic Asian (hereafter, Asian), 11.8% non-Hispanic Black (hereafter, Black), 62.8% non-Hispanic White (hereafter, White) individuals; and 2.9% individuals of other races and ethnicities (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or multiracial). After adjusting for age and sex, having a usual place for health care did not differ among adults in 2021 or 2022 vs 2019 (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] for each year, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01). However, fewer participants had wellness visits in 2022 compared with 2019 (ARR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), with the most pronounced decline among Asian adults (ARR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98). In addition, adults were less likely to delay medical care (ARR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.87) or to not receive care (ARR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83) due to cost in 2022 vs 2019. Preventive health screenings in 2021 remained below 2019 levels (blood pressure: ARR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.94-0.96]; blood glucose: ARR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.93-0.96]; and cholesterol: ARR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.92-0.94]). Eligible adults were also significantly less likely to receive colorectal cancer screening (ARR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.94), cervical cancer screening (ARR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89), breast cancer screening (ARR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97), and prostate cancer screening (ARR, 0.86 [0.78-0.94]) in 2021 vs 2019. Asian adults experienced the largest relative decreases across most preventive screenings, while Black and Hispanic adults experienced large declines in colorectal cancer screening (ARR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.91) and breast cancer screening (ARR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.91), respectively. Differences in preventive screening rates across years persisted after additional adjustment for socioeconomic factors (income, employment status, and insurance coverage).
Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this cohort study suggest that, in the US, wellness visits and preventive health screenings have not returned to prepandemic levels. These findings support the need for public health efforts to increase the use of preventive health screenings among eligible US adults.",,"Funding/Support: This study was funded by grants R01HL164561 and K23HL148525 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (Dr Wadhera).",JAMA Health Forum,,,Adult; Male; Female; Humans; Ethnicity; Early Detection of Cancer; Cross-Sectional Studies; Blood Glucose; Cohort Studies; Pandemics; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Preventive Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; Breast Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cholesterol,2024-02-02,2024,2024-02-02,2024-02-02,5,2,e235058,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alba, Christopher; Zheng, ZhaoNian; Wadhera, Rishi K.","Alba, Christopher (Richard A. and Susan F.

3779,pub.1166300758,10.1016/s0140-6736(23)02133-5,37997056,,An SMS and animated video intervention to increase uptake of breast cancer screening: a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer screening attendance in the UK has fallen, and London has the lowest uptake nationally. This study tested the impact of a behavioural science-informed reminder SMS, and animated video intervention on screening uptake.
METHODS: This three-armed randomised controlled trial took place in two screening services in London (each service operated across a range of static sites such as hospitals, and mobile sites). We included participants who were registered with GP as female, aged 50-70 years, and not screened in the past 3 years. We excluded those who had opted out of screening messages or were in care. Participants were assigned into three groups via the final two digits of their NHS number (ratio 34:33:33): control group (received usual care reminder), behavSMS group (behavioural science-informed SMS reminder addressing reducing negative emotions and information on health consequences), or behavSMS+video group (behavioural SMS plus link to animation). Researchers were masked to allocation. The SMS and video were co-designed with stakeholders using the Behaviour Change Wheel. Invitation processes changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore, we did separate analyses for those receiving a timed appointment (n=9027), and an open invitation to book an appointment (n=25 020). Messages were sent 7 days and 1 day before the appointment, plus 7 days after the open invitation letter. Group differences in the primary outcome of attendance within 3 months of invitation (and secondary outcome of booking for open invites) were assessed using χ2, and logistic regression controlling for age, ethnicity, deprivation, and first invitation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05395871.
FINDINGS: Recruitment took place between July 18, and Oct 21, 2022. For timed invitations, 3094 participants were assigned to the control group, 2952 to the behavSMS group, and 2981 to the behavSMS+video group. For open invitations groups sizes were 8654, 8095, and 8271 respectively. Median age was 59 years for participants who received a timed appointment, and 58 years for those who received an open invitation. There were no attendance differences for timed appointments (intention-to-treat analysis): 71·9% (2225/3094) in control group; 69·9% (2064/2952) in behavSMS group; 71·7% (2137/2981) in behavSMS+video group (χ2(2)=3·47, p=0·176), even when controlling for covariates. There were no attendance differences for open invitations either: 7·4% (4104/8654) in control group, 8·3% (3909/8095) in behavSMS group, 48·1% (3978/8271) in behavSMS+video (χ2(2)=1·40, p=0·497), including when controlling for covariates. However, in the per-protocol analysis (of those with valid mobile numbers), intervention groups were more likely to book an appointment: 44·7% (3238/7274) in control group, 46·3% (3121/6744) in behavSMS group, and 46·3% (3199/6910) in behavSMS+video group (χ2(2)=6·01, p=0·050).
INTERPRETATION: Despite positive stakeholder feedback during co-design, the SMS or SMS+video interventions did not increase breast screening attendance compared with the usual SMS reminder. A limitation is that only 5·8% participants followed the video link. Links within SMS are unlikely to be an effective way to disseminate video content, and alternative options are being explored.

Objective: To examine whether quality of care among patients exposed to telemedicine differs from patients with only in-person office-based care.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective cohort study, standardized quality measures were compared between patients with office-only (in-person) visits vs telemedicine visits from March 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021, across more than 200 outpatient care sites in Pennsylvania and Maryland.
Exposures: Patients completing telemedicine (video) visits.
Main Outcomes and Measures: χ2 tests determined statistically significant differences in Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality performance measures between office-only and telemedicine-exposed groups. Multivariable logistic regression controlled for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.
Results: The study included 526 874 patients (409 732 office-only; 117 142 telemedicine exposed) with a comparable distribution of sex (196 285 [49.7%] and 74 878 [63.9%] women), predominance of non-Hispanic (348 127 [85.0%] and 105 408 [90.0%]) and White individuals (334 215 [81.6%] and 100 586 [85.9%]), aged 18 to 65 years (239 938 [58.6%] and 91 100 [77.8%]), with low overall health risk scores (373 176 [91.1%] and 100 076 [85.4%]) and commercial (227 259 [55.5%] and 81 552 [69.6%]) or Medicare or Medicaid (176 671 [43.1%] and 52 513 [44.8%]) insurance. For medication-based measures, patients with office-only visits had better performance, but only 3 of 5 measures had significant differences: patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) receiving antiplatelets (absolute percentage difference [APD], 6.71%; 95% CI, 5.45%-7.98%; P < .001), patients with CVD receiving statins (APD, 1.79%; 95% CI, 0.88%-2.71%; P = .001), and avoiding antibiotics for patients with upper respiratory infections (APD, 2.05%; 95% CI, 1.17%-2.96%; P < .001); there were insignificant differences for patients with heart failure receiving β-blockers and those with diabetes receiving statins. For all 4 testing-based measures, patients with telemedicine exposure had significantly better performance differences: patients with CVD with lipid panels (APD, 7.04%; 95% CI, 5.95%-8.10%; P < .001), patients with diabetes with hemoglobin A1c testing (APD, 5.14%; 95% CI, 4.25%-6.01%; P < .001), patients with diabetes with nephropathy testing (APD, 9.28%; 95% CI, 8.22%-10.32%; P < .001), and blood pressure control (APD, 3.55%; 95% CI, 3.25%-3.85%; P < .001); this was also true for all 7 counseling-based measures: cervical cancer screening (APD, 12.33%; 95% CI, 11.80%-12.85%; P < .001), breast cancer screening (APD, 16.90%; 95% CI, 16.07%-17.71%; P < .001), colon cancer screening (APD, 8.20%; 95% CI, 7.65%-8.75%; P < .001), tobacco counseling and intervention (APD, 12.67%; 95% CI, 11.84%-13.50%; P < .001), influenza vaccination (APD, 9.76%; 95% CI, 9.47%-10.05%; P < .001), pneumococcal vaccination (APD, 5.41%; 95% CI, 4.85%-6.00%; P < .001), and depression screening (APD, 4.85%; 95% CI, 4.66%-5.04%; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with telemedicine exposure, there was a largely favorable association with quality of primary care. This supports telemedicine's value potential for augmenting care capacity, especially in chronic disease management and preventive care. This study also identifies a need for understanding relationships between the optimal blend of telemedicine and in-office care.",,,JAMA Network Open,,,"Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; COVID-19; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Diabetes Mellitus; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lipids; Male; Medicare; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Telemedicine; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2022-09-01,2022,2022-09-26,2022-09-01,5,9,e2233267,All OA; Gold,Article,"Baughman, Derek J.; Jabbarpour, Yalda; Westfall, John M.; Jetty, Anuradha; Zain, Areeba; Baughman, Kathryn; Pollak, Brian; Waheed, Abdul","Baughman, Derek J.

Breast cancer incidence is actually the highest one among all cancers. Overall breast cancer management is associated with challenges considering risk assessment and predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention of metastatic disease, appropriate treatment options, and cost-effectiveness of approaches applied. Accumulated research evidence indicates promising anti-cancer effects of phytochemicals protecting cells against malignant transformation, inhibiting carcinogenesis and metastatic spread, supporting immune system and increasing effectiveness of conventional anti-cancer therapies, among others. Molecular and sub-/cellular mechanisms are highly complex affecting several pathways considered potent targets for advanced diagnostics and cost-effective treatments. Demonstrated anti-cancer affects, therefore, are clinically relevant for improving individual outcomes and might be applicable to the primary (protection against initial cancer development), secondary (protection against potential metastatic disease development), and tertiary (towards cascading complications) care. However, a detailed data analysis is essential to adapt treatment algorithms to individuals’ and patients’ needs. Consequently, advanced concepts of patient stratification, predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and treatments tailored to the individualized patient profile are instrumental for the cost-effective application of natural anti-cancer substances to improve overall breast cancer management benefiting affected individuals and the society at large.",,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women and few studies have investigated the outcomes of patients with a history of breast cancer and COVID-19. We report the clinical outcomes of patients with invasive breast cancer who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including hospitalization and death, and evaluate demographic and cancer-related factors associated with these outcomes.
PATIENTS: Patients with a history of invasive breast cancer and positive SARS-CoV-2 test from January 1 to December 31, 2020 at two large, academic Los Angeles health systems were included.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of the electronic medical record was performed. Data for demographic and cancer-related factors were manually abstracted. Relationships between outcomes and clinical variables were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Among a total of 132 patients, 40 (30.3%) were hospitalized, while 11 (8.3%) required intensive care support, and 8 patients (6.1%) died. Older age and presence of one or more additional comorbidities were associated with hospitalization and death (P = .010, P = .003, P = .034, P < .001). Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity was associated with hospitalization (P = .047). Cancer treatment was not associated with hospitalization or death.
CONCLUSION: In our diverse, multi-center, breast cancer cohort, Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity, older age and presence of other comorbidities were associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. Breast cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation, systemic therapy, and endocrine therapy, was not associated with hospitalization in our cohort. Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between breast cancer and COVID-19 outcomes.",,,Clinical Breast Cancer,,,Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Los Angeles; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2,2021-12-17,2021,2021-12-17,2022-06,22,4,e558-e566,All OA; Green,Article,"Kathuria-Prakash, Nikhita; Antrim, Lauren; Hornstein, Nicholas; Sun, Alexander W; Kang, Irene M; Baclig, Nikita V; Angell, Trevor E; Lechner, Melissa G; Wald-Dickler, Noah; In, Gino K","Kathuria-Prakash, Nikhita (Department of Medicine, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095.); Antrim, Lauren (Department of Medicine, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033.); Hornstein, Nicholas (Department of Medicine, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095.); Sun, Alexander W (UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095.); Kang, Irene M (Division of Oncology, USC Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA 90033.); Baclig, Nikita V (Division of Hematology and Oncology, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095.); Angell, Trevor E (Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033.); Lechner, Melissa G (Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095.); Wald-Dickler, Noah (Department of Medicine, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033; Division of Infectious Diseases, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033.); In, Gino K (Division of Oncology, USC Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA 90033.)","In, Gino K (USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center)","Kathuria-Prakash, Nikhita (University of California, Los Angeles); Antrim, Lauren (University of Southern California); Hornstein, Nicholas (University of California, Los Angeles); Sun, Alexander W (University of California, Los Angeles); Kang, Irene M (USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center); Baclig, Nikita V (University of California, Los Angeles); Angell, Trevor E (University of Southern California); Lechner, Melissa G (University of California, Los Angeles); Wald-Dickler, Noah (University of Southern California); In, Gino K (USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center)",5,5,0.39,1.53,https://escholarship.org/content/qt9553q1zr/qt9553q1zr.pdf?t=rxe75x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143936120,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Objective: To develop a risk-based strategy for triaging mammograms during periods of decreased capacity.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data collected prospectively from mammography examinations performed in 2014 to 2019 at 92 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Participants included individuals undergoing mammography. Data were analyzed from August 10 to November 3, 2020.
Exposures: Clinical indication for screening, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, age, time since last mammogram/screening interval, family history of breast cancer, breast density, and history of high-risk breast lesion.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Combinations of clinical indication, clinical history, and breast cancer risk factors that subdivided mammograms into risk groups according to their cancer detection rate were identified using classification and regression trees.
Results: The cohort included 898 415 individuals contributing 1 878 924 mammograms (mean [SD] age at mammogram, 58.6 [11.2] years) interpreted by 448 radiologists, with 1 722 820 mammograms in individuals without a personal history of breast cancer and 156 104 mammograms in individuals with a history of breast cancer. Most individuals were aged 50 to 69 years at imaging (1 113 174 mammograms [59.2%]), and 204 305 (11.2%) were Black, 206 087 (11.3%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 126 677 (7.0%) were Hispanic or Latina, and 40 021 (2.2%) were another race/ethnicity or mixed race/ethnicity. Cancer detection rates varied widely based on clinical indication, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, and age. The 12% of mammograms with very high (89.6 [95% CI, 82.3-97.5] to 122.3 [95% CI, 108.1-138.0] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) or high (36.1 [95% CI, 33.1-39.3] to 47.5 [95% CI, 42.4-53.3] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) cancer detection rates accounted for 55% of all detected cancers and included mammograms to evaluate an abnormal mammogram or breast lump in individuals of all ages regardless of breast cancer history, to evaluate breast symptoms other than lump in individuals with a breast cancer history or without a history but aged 60 years or older, and for short-interval follow-up in individuals aged 60 years or older without a breast cancer history. The 44.2% of mammograms with very low cancer detection rates accounted for 13.1% of detected cancers and included annual screening mammograms in individuals aged 50 to 69 years (3.8 [95% CI, 3.5-4.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) and all screening mammograms in individuals younger than 50 years regardless of screening interval (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6-3.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this population-based cohort study, clinical indication and individual risk factors were associated with cancer detection and may be useful for prioritizing mammography in times and settings of decreased capacity.",,"Funding/Support: This work was supported through a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute program award (No. PCS-1504-30370).

3508,pub.1164768484,,37800299,,[A Case of COVID-19 Infection during Postoperative Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Treated with Antibody Cocktail Therapy to Prevent Disease Aggravation].,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic, and it has been reported that patients with cancer are at high risk of developing complications from the disease. However, we believe that prolonged interruption of chemotherapy due to extended COVID-19 treatment is not desirable, given the intensity of cancer treatment. We report a case of COVID-19 infection during postoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer, in which antibody cocktail therapy prevented disease aggravation and delayed breast cancer treatment. The patient is a 45-year-old woman who came to our hospital with a complaint of a right mammary mass. The mass was diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma with an ER and PR of 0%, a HER2 score of 1+, and a Ki-67 of 90%. After preoperative chemotherapy, she underwent a right mastectomy and axillary dissection. The pathology result showed non-pCR. The administration of capecitabine was started as adjuvant therapy. On day 8 of cycle 3, she developed a fever in the 39℃ range, and on the next day, a COVID-19 POC gene test confirmed that the patient was positive for infection. On the same day, neutralizing antibody drugs(casirivimab and imdevimab)were administered as antibody cocktail therapy. Two days after treatment(day 11), a blood test showed Grade 3 neutropenia, but there was no recurrence of fever or evidence of pneumonia. After 2 weeks, capecitabine was resumed, and the patient was able to complete 8 cycles of capecitabine therapy without any major complications.",,,Cancer & chemotherapy,,,Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Capecitabine; Combined Antibody Therapeutics; COVID-19; COVID-19 Drug Treatment; Mastectomy,2023-09,2023,,2023-09,50,9,1009-1011,Closed,Article,"Takashima, Yuko; Terasawa, Risa; Hirata, Aoko; Morita, Shinsho; Kimura, Kousei; Iwamoto, Mitsuhiko; Hayashi, Michihiro","Takashima, Yuko (Dept. of Breast Surgery, Hirakata City Hospital.); Terasawa, Risa (); Hirata, Aoko (); Morita, Shinsho (); Kimura, Kousei (); Iwamoto, Mitsuhiko (); Hayashi, Michihiro ()",,"Takashima, Yuko (Dept. of Breast Surgery, Hirakata City Hospital.); Terasawa, Risa (); Hirata, Aoko (); Morita, Shinsho (); Kimura, Kousei (); Iwamoto, Mitsuhiko (); Hayashi, Michihiro ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164768484,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Prep for Pandemic,"INTRODUCTION: In COVID-19 pandemic epicenters cancer care was severely impacted. All elective and semi-elective procedures, as well as select urgent cases, were postponed in order to preserve resources and protect patients and staff from SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Structured decision making for breast cancer treatment resulted in deferment of surgery with initiation of endocrine therapy. Moreover, the waitlist for elective breast cancer procedures after mitigation is a challenge for prioritization.
OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE: We aim to summarize the current body of evidence, comparatively evaluate oncological outcomes of surgery versus primary endocrine therapy (PET), and determine whether PET is a viable long-term alternative to surgery in the context of crisis management strategy for early, operable hormone receptor positive (HRP) breast cancer. PET could potentially be an acceptable bridging or maintenance therapy in select patients during pandemic crisis or for those choosing to forgo surgery in the treatment of breast cancer.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The database search includes PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (via Ovid). This systematic review includes women 18 years or older undergoing one of two interventions for HRP breast cancer: surgery (with or without endocrine therapy post-surgery) or solely PET. Studies comparing one of the two interventions of interest to a non-relevant intervention and studies reporting only descriptive data will not be included in the quantitative synthesis of data. After selection of eligible studies based on title and abstract, these studies will be further screened through full text articles by two independent reviewers, with a third as an arbitrator. Eligible studies will be critically appraised at the study level for methodological quality. Cochrane methodology will be utilized for meta-analysis.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does not require an institutional review board approval given its summary design nature.

Data were collected from the Ambulatory Information System relating to ""bilateral screening mammography"" from January/2015 to December/2021. Analyses were performed by region and for Brazil. The average of exams in each month of the year was calculated based on 2015-2019 data, which was compared, monthly, with the number of exams in 2020 and 2021, obtaining the gross and percentage difference between these values. The same analysis was performed for the total number of exams in 2020 and 2021, individually, and for the two years combined. In 2020 there were reductions in the number of exams, which ranged from 25% (North) to 48% (Northeast), resulting in 1.749 million fewer exams than expected in the country (a drop of 44%). In 2021, the Midwest region presented a number of exams 11% higher than expected, while the other regions presented drops between 17% (North) and 27% (Southeast/South), resulting in 927 thousand exams fewer than expected in Brazil (reduction of 23%).

3395,pub.1135462143,10.1188/21.onf.129-130,33600389,,Positive Yet Unequal Trends.,"The American Cancer Society recently reported a second consecutive year of very positive data regarding cancer survival. Although the latest data may have been affected by pandemic-associated delays, the trend in the data indicates that the overall death rate from cancer in the United States continues to decline. The death rate from cancer has fallen 31% from 1991 to 2018, with an estimated 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths during that interval than would have occurred if death rates had remained at their peak level (based on five-year age-specific, sex-specific, and population-based data). Multiple factors have contributed to this improvement in cancer survival. For example, notable improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have resulted in overall survival increasing from 30% in the 1960s to greater than 80% in most high-income countries in 2020. In addition, vaccines against human papillomavirus are reducing cervical cancer risk, enhancement in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment have led to marked survival gains, and targeted therapies (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors) for malignant melanoma have increased long-term survival by 50% in some cases. However, other cancer types, such as pancreatic and brain, have seen lower levels of improvement.",,,Oncology Nursing Forum,,,Breast Neoplasms; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Melanoma; Skin Neoplasms; United States,2021-03-01,2021,2021-03-01,2021-03-01,48,2,129-130,Closed,Article,"Lyon, Deborah","Lyon, Deborah ()",,"Lyon, Deborah ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135462143,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The methods used in the research include historical-biographical analysis, content analysis, and a systemic approach.
RESULTS: Results: According to the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine, from 2014 to 2020, there were stable figures of malignant neoplasms (MN) with a 1% increase in morbidity. The lowest rate was observed in 2014, with 135.307 new cases of MN, showing a slight increase until 2019 with 138.509 new cases. Starting from 2020, there has been a decrease in the registration of new MN cases, such as 113.368 new cases in 2020, in 2021-120.055, and 93.276 in 2022. The decrease in new MN cases is attributed to limited access to medical services for the population residing in annexed territories and areas affected by ongoing military actions.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: A relatively stable increase in breast cancer incidence is observed from 2014 to 2020, within a 1% range, followed by a sharp decrease from 2020 to 2022.

Based on the Projeto de Avaliação de Desempenho do Sistema de Saúde, 31 indicators of funding, resources, access, effectiveness, acceptability, and appropriateness were selected for the period of 2017-2020, and were compared to the variations of each year's indicators year on year. In 2020, an increase in funding, especially SUS transfers (31.6%), was observed. The availability of hospital beds had been decreasing between 2017 and 2019, but began to increase again in 2020; likewise, the availability of health professionals also showed a slight increase. A decline was observed in cervical and breast cancer screening exams of nearly 40% (2020), as well as a decrease in surgical procedures, such as cataracts and angioplasties. The hospitalizations due to conditions manageable by primary care were 15.8% in 2020, 14.1% lower than in 2019.

The hypothesis is based on the observation that the majority of patients in need of intensive care are male, and the connection between androgen receptor signalling and expression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme important for SARS-CoV-2 host cell internalization.Trial designHospitalised COVID-19 patients will be randomised (2:1) to enzalutamide plus standard of care vs. standard of care designed to identify superiority.ParticipantsIncluded participants, men or women above 50 years of age, must be hospitalised for PCR confirmed COVID-19 symptoms and not in need of immediate mechanical ventilation. Major exclusion criteria are breast-feeding or pregnant women, hormonal treatment for prostate or breast cancer, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, current symptomatic unstable cardiovascular disease (see Additional file 1 for further details). The trial is registered at Umeå University Hospital, Region Västerbotten, Sweden and 8 hospitals are approved for inclusion in Sweden.Intervention and comparatorPatients randomised to the treatment arm will be treated orally with 160 mg (4x40 mg) enzalutamide (Xtandi®) daily, for five consecutive days. The study is not placebo controlled. The comparator is standard of care treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.Main outcomesThe primary endpoints of the study are (time to) need of mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital as assessed by a clinical 7-point ordinal scale (up to 30 days after inclusion).RandomisationRandomisation was stratified by center and sex. Each strata was randomized separately with block size six with a 2:1 allocation ratio (enzalutamide + “standard of care”: “standard of care”).

Oncological screenings represent an effective secondary prevention strategy to counteract colorectal and breast cancers, significantly reducing mortality. In Lombardy Region (Northern Italy), screening programmes have been active since 2007, but adherence, especially in specific population subgroups, remains lower than expected.
OBJECTIVES: to analyse potential predictors of non-adherence to colorectal and breast cancer screening in the Lombardy Region during the pre-pandemic period of 2018-2019.
DESIGN: a retrospective cohort study aimed at investigating the role of sociodemographic variables, health status, and access to the healthcare system on non-adherence to colorectal and breast cancer screening. Statistical analyses were conducted separately by each Agency for Health Protection (ATS). The results of the models were synthesized across the Lombardy region through random-effects meta-analysis.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: residents within the territory of each ATS in Lombardy as of 01.01.2018 and aged between 49 and 69 years at the beginning of the follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: adherence to colorectal and breast cancer screenings.
RESULTS: during the study period, across the Lombardy Region, 2,820,138 individuals were eligible to participate in colorectal cancer screening, and 1,357,344 women were eligible to participate in breast cancer screening, with an invitation coverage of 87% and 86%, respectively.For breast cancer screening, older age, cardiopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), autoimmune diseases, and presence of a rare disease are associated with a reduced risk of non-adherence. Conversely, foreign citizenship, oncological diagnosis, transplant, chronic kidney disease/dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, arterial or cerebral vasculopathy, and presence of a neurological diagnosis are associated with significant excess risks of non-participation. For colorectal cancer screening, factors favouring adherence include female gender, older age, cardiopathy, COPD, autoimmune diseases, and having access/utilization of primary care. Non-adherence is associated with foreign citizenship, transplant, chronic kidney disease/dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, arterial or cerebral vasculopathy, IBD, neurological diseases, residence in assisted living facilities, use of integrated home care, and presence of disability.
CONCLUSIONS: this is the first study conducted in the Lombardy Region which explores the theme of equity of access to organized screenings. This analysis highlights how sociodemographic determinants, chronic conditions, and access to the healthcare and social healthcare system constitute significant risk factors for non-adherence to screening programmes. Based on the results of this analysis, communication and/or organizational change interventions will be developed to counteract inequalities in access to effective prevention procedures.",,,Epidemiologia & Prevenzione,,,Humans; Italy; Breast Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Aged; Early Detection of Cancer; Male; Mass Screening; Patient Compliance; Pandemics; Health Services Accessibility; Cohort Studies,2024,2024,,2024,48,2,118-129,Closed,Article,"Russo, Antonio Giampiero; Murtas, Rossella; Ballotari, Paola; Cavalieri d'Oro, Luca; Gambino, Maria Letizia; Fanetti, Anna Clara; Maifredi, Giovanni; Manzoni, Federica; Sampietro, Giuseppe; Leoni, Olivia; Celata, Corrado; Cereda, Danilo; Deandrea, Silvia","Russo, Antonio Giampiero (SC Unità di Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Città Metropolitana di Milano, Milano; agrusso@ats-milano.it.); Murtas, Rossella (SC Unità di Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Città Metropolitana di Milano, Milano.); Ballotari, Paola (SC Osservatorio Epidemiologico, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Val Padana, Mantova.); Cavalieri d'Oro, Luca (SC Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Brianza, Monza.); Gambino, Maria Letizia (SS Epidemiologico Registri specializzati e reti di patologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Insubria, Varese.); Fanetti, Anna Clara (Struttura di Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Montagna, Sondrio.); Maifredi, Giovanni (SS Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Brescia, Brescia.); Manzoni, Federica (SC Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Pavia, Pavia.); Sampietro, Giuseppe (Servizio Epidemiologico Aziendale, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Bergamo, Bergamo.); Leoni, Olivia (DG Welfare Regione Lombardia, Milano.); Celata, Corrado (DG Welfare Regione Lombardia, Milano.); Cereda, Danilo (DG Welfare Regione Lombardia, Milano.); Deandrea, Silvia (DG Welfare Regione Lombardia, Milano.; SC Medicina Preventiva nelle Comunità, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute di Pavia, Pavia.)",,"Russo, Antonio Giampiero (SC Unità di Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Città Metropolitana di Milano, Milano; agrusso@ats-milano.it.); Murtas, Rossella (SC Unità di Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Città Metropolitana di Milano, Milano.); Ballotari, Paola (SC Osservatorio Epidemiologico, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Val Padana, Mantova.); Cavalieri d'Oro, Luca (SC Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Brianza, Monza.); Gambino, Maria Letizia (SS Epidemiologico Registri specializzati e reti di patologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Insubria, Varese.); Fanetti, Anna Clara (Struttura di Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Montagna, Sondrio.); Maifredi, Giovanni (SS Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Brescia, Brescia.); Manzoni, Federica (SC Epidemiologia, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Pavia, Pavia.); Sampietro, Giuseppe (Servizio Epidemiologico Aziendale, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute Bergamo, Bergamo.); Leoni, Olivia (Regione Lombardia); Celata, Corrado (Regione Lombardia); Cereda, Danilo (Regione Lombardia); Deandrea, Silvia (Regione Lombardia; SC Medicina Preventiva nelle Comunità, Agenzia di Tutela della Salute di Pavia, Pavia.)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171836456,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Timely detection with mammography has emerged as the primary tool for mass screening. This retrospective study, which is part of the Chiraiya Project, aimed to evaluate breast lesion patients identified during opportunistic mammography screening camps in Jammu Province, India.MethodsA total of 1505 women aged 40 years and older were screened using a mobile mammographic unit over a five-year period, excluding 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion criterion was women in the specified age group, while the exclusion criterion was women with open breast wounds, history of breast cancer or a history of breast surgery. The screening process involved comprehensive data collection using a detailed Proforma, followed by mammographic assessments conducted within strategically stationed mobile units. Radiological interpretations utilizing the BI-RADS system were performed, accompanied by meticulous documentation of patient demographics, habits, literacy, medical history, and breastfeeding practices. Participants were recruited through collaborations with NGOs, army camps, village panchayats, and urban cooperatives. Screening camps were scheduled periodically, with each camp accommodating 90 patients or fewer.ResultsAmong the 1505 patients, most were aged 45–50 years. The number of screenings increased yearly, peaking at 441 in 2022. The BI-RADS II was the most common finding (48.77%), indicating the presence of benign lesions, while the BI-RADS 0 (32.96%) required further evaluation. Higher-risk categories (BI-RADS III, IV, V) were less common, with BI-RADS V being the rarest. Follow-up adherence was highest in the BI-RADS III, IV, and V categories, with BI-RADS V achieving 100% follow-up. However, only 320 of 496 BI-RADS 0 patients were followed up, indicating a gap in continuity of care. The overall follow-up rate was 66.89%. Compared to urban areas, rural areas demonstrated greater screening uptake but lower follow-up rates, highlighting the need for tailored interventions to improve follow-up care access, especially in rural contexts.ConclusionThis study underscores the efficacy of a mobile mammographic unit in reaching marginalized populations. Adherence to screening protocols has emerged as a linchpin for early detection, improved prognosis, and holistic public health enhancement. Addressing misconceptions surrounding mammographic screenings, especially in rural settings, is crucial. These findings call for intensified efforts in advocacy and education to promote the benefits of breast cancer screening initiatives. Future interventions should prioritize improving access to follow-up care and addressing screening to enhance breast cancer management in Jammu Province.","We would like to express our gratitude to the administration, public relations department, and Radiology department of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Super Specialty Hospital, Katra, with special acknowledgment to our diligent technicians, whose unwavering support and efforts were instrumental in the success of this project.",The authors declare that this study received no financial support.,BMC Public Health,,,Humans; Female; Mammography; India; Breast Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Early Detection of Cancer; Adult; Mobile Health Units; Aged; Mass Screening,2024-08-01,2024,2024-08-01,,24,1,2087,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gupta, Geetanjali; Jamwal, Neetu; Gupta, Raghav","Gupta, Geetanjali (Department of Radiology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Narayana Super Specialty Hospital Kakryal, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India); Jamwal, Neetu (Department of General Surgery, Government Medical College Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India); Gupta, Raghav (Poznań University of Medical Sciences, Poznań, Poland)","Jamwal, Neetu (Government Medical College)","Gupta, Geetanjali (Department of Radiology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Narayana Super Specialty Hospital Kakryal, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India); Jamwal, Neetu (Government Medical College); Gupta, Raghav (Poznan University of Medical Sciences)",0,0,,,https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12889-024-19622-3,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174406198,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Despite the challenge of convening global contributors to both the conference itself as well as the important Consensus Panel, the scientific committee and the organizers managed to organize a well-received scientific conference, and also the panel discussion was well received in the worldwide scientific community, as indicated by numerous positive feedbacks already within the first 24 h. The virtual format was unusual, but opened the door for new elements such as Consensus questions proposed from the audience, but also live audience interaction on both days - the Consensus was split into 2 parts in order to accommodate as many time zones globally as possible, leading to almost a doubling of discussion time compared to previous meetings. Also, about 3,400 participants from over 100 countries and all continents came together, including many colleagues who could attend for the first time from world regions with restrictions that so far did not allow the travel to Vienna. Traditionally, the Panel votings and discussions were preceded by 3 days of high-level live-discussions about the lectures that were available on demand already a week before. Also, all the lectures and live discussions in mini-panels are made available online for at least 6 months (https://www.oncoconferences.ch/events/bcc-2021/). The traditional panel votings were once more moderated by Eric Winer from Harvard and included interactive elements such as audience votings and audience questions, presented by Michael Gnant. This rapid report by the editors-in-chief of Breast Care summarizes the results of the 2021 international panel votings with respect to locoregional and systemic treatment as a quick news update for our readers and clearly does not intend to replace the official St. Gallen Consensus publication that will follow shortly in Annals of Oncology.",,,Breast Care,,,,2021-04-07,2021,2021-04-07,2021,16,2,135-143,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Thomssen, Christoph; Balic, Marija; Harbeck, Nadia; Gnant, Michael","Thomssen, Christoph (Department of Gynaecology, Martin-Luther-University, Halle an der Saale, Germany.); Balic, Marija (Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Medical University Graz, Graz, Austria.); Harbeck, Nadia (Breast Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Munich (LMU), Munich, Germany.); Gnant, Michael (Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.)",,"Thomssen, Christoph (Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg); Balic, Marija (Medical University of Graz); Harbeck, Nadia (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München); Gnant, Michael (Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna)",106,51,7.31,38.68,https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/516114,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136994391,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Pertuzumab is currently approved with an initial loading dose of 840 mg, followed by a 420-mg maintenance dose intravenously every 3 weeks. A reloading dose is required if there is a ≥6-week delay in treatment. In response to the potential treatment disruption due to COVID-19, the impact of dose delays and alternative dosing regimens on intravenous pertuzumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer treatment is presented. Simulations were conducted by using the validated population pharmacokinetic model for pertuzumab, and included (1) 4-, 6-, and 9-week dose delays of the 840 mg/420 mg every 3 weeks dosing regimen and (2) 840 mg/420 mg every 4 weeks and 840 mg every 6 weeks alternative dosing regimens. Simulations were compared with the currently approved pertuzumab dosing regimen. The simulations in 1000 virtual patients showed that a dose reload (840 mg) is required following a dose delay of ≥6 weeks to maintain comparable Ctrough (lowest concentration before the next dose is given) levels to clinical trials. The 840 mg/420 mg every 4 weeks and 840 mg every 6 weeks alternative dosing regimens decrease median steady-state Ctrough by ≈40% compared with the approved regimen, and <90% of patients will be above the target Ctrough . Thus, the alternative 840 mg/420 mg every 4 weeks and 840 mg every 6 weeks pertuzumab dosing regimens are not recommended. Flexibility for intravenous PERJETA-based regimens is available with an alternative route of pertuzumab administration (subcutaneous vs intravenous).","Acknowledgments The authors thank all the patients and investigators for their participation in the clinical studies.

After 4 years and one virtual event due to the pandemic, more than 2,800 participants from over 100 countries came together in Vienna, and the 2023 St. Gallen/Vienna conference was a great success. Over 3 days, the global faculty reviewed the most important evidence published during the last 2 years and debated over controversial topics, and finally, the consensus votes aimed to define the impact of the new data on everyday routine practice. Focuses of this year's conference were radiotherapy and local management of the axilla, genetics, and their impact on treatment, as well as the role of the immune system and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in pathological reports and treatment decision-making. The traditional panel votes were moderated for the first time by Harold Burstein from Boston, and with questions previously voted on and live voting, the panel managed for the most part to clarify the critical questions. This report by editors of BREAST CARE summarizes the results of the 2023 international panel votes with respect to locoregional and systemic treatment as a brief news update but does not intend to replace the official St. Gallen Consensus publication that not just reports but also interprets the panel votes and will follow shortly in a major oncological journal.

Cancer management is also being streamlined at the Center and district levels, such that comprehensive integrated management is offered to cases to optimize the best results. In breast cancer, there are two modes of surgery namely Breast Conservation Surgery(BCS) and Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) now over 2 decades, with recommended Chemo radiation depending on the extent of the disease. HRQOL (Health-related Quality of Life) studies have been done in these groups of patients, due to their added relevance in terms of the loss of a vital organ like the breast. EORTC 30 and BR23 are standardized and detailed tools that have been seen to estimate QOL, keeping in mind a whole array of domains that are affected by the disease.
Objective: To evaluate the ""Body Image"" and ""Quality of life"" (QOL) in operated breast cancer patients using BR -23 and EORTC - QLQ- questionnaire at 1month (after surgery) and then 3 to 4 months after surgery.
Methods: This article attempts to draw a comparison among of EORTC30 and BR 23 scores calculated for 46 breast cancer patients operated during the pandemic time in one center and consenting to repeat the measures at pre-decided three time periods during the course of management.
Results: No significant differences are noted in the mean scores for EORTC 30 and BR23 for the two types of surgeries. Visit 1 scores for both modes of surgery are over 75 and by Visit 3 become less than 55 for EORTC. BR 23 (which measures the symptoms core to Breast cancer) at all 3 visits are between 45 to 55. Friedman's test shows that the scores are not significant for age groups, the number of living children, or lifestyle factors like alcohol or tobacco chewing, though quadratic graphs depict the distinct variations in the scores at the 3 times reinforcing the need for follow-up of mental health in these subjects at intervals. The study largely brings out a strong need for repeated follow-up and counseling at regular and short intervals, post-surgery in breast cancer patients. EORTC 30 and BR 23 tools are excellent to use to essay information on the mental health of patients with breast cancer.",,,Indian Journal of Community Medicine,,,,2024-05-24,2024,2024-05-24,2024-05,49,3,501-507,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kar, Sonali; Shrivastava, Varsha; Meena, Jitendra Kumar; Mohapatra, Ipsa; Sahoo, Saroj Ranjan; Kar, Madhabananda","Kar, Sonali (Department of Community Medicine, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India); Shrivastava, Varsha (Department of Community Medicine, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India); Meena, Jitendra Kumar (National Cancer Institute (NCI), Jhajjar, AIIMS New Delhi, India); Mohapatra, Ipsa (Department of Surgical Oncology, KIMS, KIIT University and ED AIIMS Darbhanga, Bihar, India); Sahoo, Saroj Ranjan (Department of Surgical Oncology, KIMS, KIIT University and ED AIIMS Darbhanga, Bihar, India); Kar, Madhabananda (Department of Surgical Oncology, KIMS, KIIT University and ED AIIMS Darbhanga, Bihar, India)","Kar, Sonali (KIIT University)","Kar, Sonali (KIIT University); Shrivastava, Varsha (KIIT University); Meena, Jitendra Kumar (All India Institute of Medical Sciences); Mohapatra, Ipsa (Department of Surgical Oncology, KIMS, KIIT University and ED AIIMS Darbhanga, Bihar, India); Sahoo, Saroj Ranjan (Department of Surgical Oncology, KIMS, KIIT University and ED AIIMS Darbhanga, Bihar, India); Kar, Madhabananda (Department of Surgical Oncology, KIMS, KIIT University and ED AIIMS Darbhanga, Bihar, India)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijcm.ijcm_390_23,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172065755,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

Yet today, it is clearly agreed that sleep disorders represent both a cancer risk factor and a biological consequence of the of the activation of the immuno-inflammatory system induced by cancer itself.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of sleep disorders on quality of life and identify the type of disorder and its causes in order to offer an adapted and personalized care plan.
METHODS: In a survey completed during the COVID-19 lockdown, 2000 hours of interviews were collected by remote consultations. During these calls, we administered a sleep questionnaire. This questionnaire was inspired by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and enquired about 6 items. The demographic details of each patient (eg, age and sex), the nature of the pathology, their past treatments, the ongoing cancer treatment, the mood, whether or not the patient is anxious or depressed, and the use of sleeping drug pills were analyzed. A univariate analysis was performed according to the presence or absence of fatigue. Chi-square test was applied to assess possible differences of variables' link to sleep disturbance between patients complaining of fatigue and those without fatigue. The same test was then used to analyze patients on hormone therapy and those with no hormone therapy for 2 types of cancer-breast cancer and prostate cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 905 patients were prospectively included in this study. The average age was 66.7 (5 SD) years, and 606 (67%) patients were women; 142 patients declared being overweight. Breast cancer was the most frequently reported cancer. Nocturnal awakening was reported by 70% (n=633), fatigue by 50% (n=452), difficulty falling asleep by 38% (n=343), snoring reported by an independent observer in 38% (n=343), and apnea reported by an independent observer in 9% (n=81) of the patients. The univariate analysis showed that the feeling of tiredness was significantly greater in patients reporting difficulty falling asleep (P≥.99), pain (P<.001), and frequent awakening (P<.001), as well as in patients who were not receiving cancer treatment (P<.001). The univariate analysis showed that patients who were receiving breast cancer treatment and were under hormone therapy reported difficulty falling asleep (P=.04) and pain (P=.05). In a univariate analysis of patients treated for prostate cancer, being overweight was the only factor reported that had a statistically significant value.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data support and are consistent with data in the literature regarding the importance of sleep disorders in oncology. This justifies the usefulness of a diagnosis and early treatment of sleep disorders in patients with cancer. The Rafael Institute sleep observatory will enable patients to be identified and treated.",,,JMIR Formative Research,,,,2022-11-24,2022,2022-11-24,,6,11,e37371,All OA; Gold,Article,"Scher, Nathaniel; Guetta, Liath; Draghi, Clément; Yahiaoui, Safia; Terzioglu, Mathilde; Butaye, Emilie; Henriques, Kathy; Alavoine, Marie; Elharar, Ayala; Guetta, Andre; Toledano, Alain","Scher, Nathaniel (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France; Hartmann Oncology Radiotherapy Group, Hartmann Radiotherapy Institute, Levallois Perret, France); Guetta, Liath (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Draghi, Clément (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Yahiaoui, Safia (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France; Department of Radiotherapy, Institut Salah Azaiz, Tunis, Tunisia); Terzioglu, Mathilde (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Butaye, Emilie (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Henriques, Kathy (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Alavoine, Marie (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Elharar, Ayala (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Guetta, Andre (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Toledano, Alain (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France; Department of Integrative Medicine, National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, Paris, France)","Scher, Nathaniel (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France; Hartmann Oncology Radiotherapy Group, Hartmann Radiotherapy Institute, Levallois Perret, France)","Scher, Nathaniel (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France; Hartmann Oncology Radiotherapy Group, Hartmann Radiotherapy Institute, Levallois Perret, France); Guetta, Liath (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Draghi, Clément (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Yahiaoui, Safia (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France; Institut Salah-Azaïz); Terzioglu, Mathilde (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Butaye, Emilie (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Henriques, Kathy (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Alavoine, Marie (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Elharar, Ayala (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Guetta, Andre (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France); Toledano, Alain (Integrative Medicine, Rafael Institute, Levallois-Perret, France; Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers)",1,1,0.37,0.71,https://formative.jmir.org/2022/11/e37371/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151464260,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being
